    stimulus: `A recent study found that employees who take regular breaks during the workday are more productive than those who work continuously. Therefore, companies should mandate that all employees take breaks every hour, as this will certainly increase overall company productivity.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that mandating breaks will produce the same productivity benefits as voluntary breaks. However, the study only showed that employees who choose to take breaks are more productive. Forcing breaks on employees may not yield the same results, as the voluntary nature of the breaks might be a key factor in the productivity increase.",

    explanation: "The critic's method is to point to a previous case (the photography exhibition) where a similar prediction (attracting younger visitors) failed. By showing that a past analogous prediction was wrong, the critic suggests this new prediction is likely wrong too. This is reasoning by analogy to a prior failed case.",

    explanation: "The argument relies on patients 'feeling better' as evidence of the drug's effectiveness. However, it fails to consider that subjective improvements could be due to placebo effects rather than the drug itself. Without objective measures of improvement, the reported feelings could be psychological rather than pharmaceutical effects.",

They theorize that this pesticide impairs the bees' navigation abilities, preventing foraging bees from returning to the hive and ultimately causing colony failure.`,

Choice B provides direct experimental evidence supporting this mechanism—bees exposed to the pesticide do indeed have difficulty navigating.

She points to several successful tech startups that operate with flat organizational structures without middle managers. These companies have shown exceptional innovation and rapid growth, proving that middle management is unnecessary and even counterproductive.`,

    explanation: "The consultant generalizes from small tech startups to all companies. Choice B points out a crucial disanalogy: the startups are much smaller than most companies. What works for a 100-person startup may not work for a company with thousands of employees, where coordination challenges are fundamentally different.
