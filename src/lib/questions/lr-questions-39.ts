    stimulus: `A recent study found that employees who take regular breaks throughout the workday are more productive than those who work continuously. Therefore, companies should mandate that all employees take a fifteen-minute break every two hours, as this will necessarily increase overall productivity.`,

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that what works for some employees will work equally well for all employees" },

      { letter: "E", text: "does not specify what activities employees should engage in during breaks" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that because voluntary breaks correlate with productivity, mandated breaks will produce the same result. This overlooks the key difference between chosen and imposed behavior. Employees who voluntarily take breaks may do so at optimal times for their work rhythms, while mandated breaks at fixed intervals may interrupt productive work periods.",

These systems required significant engineering knowledge and coordinated labor to construct. Historians have therefore concluded that these ancient societies must have had centralized governmental structures capable of organizing large-scale public works projects.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If construction required workers from multiple districts collaborating over extended periods, this strongly suggests the need for centralized coordination and authority. Local, decentralized efforts would be unlikely to achieve such inter-district cooperation without some form of central government directing the project.",

They point to studies showing that cities with major sports venues have more vibrant downtown areas with higher property values and more businesses. The council concludes that the stadium will cause similar economic benefits for our city.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This answer reveals a potential reverse causation problem. If cities that built stadiums already had thriving downtowns, then the vibrant urban areas may have attracted the stadiums rather than the stadiums causing the vibrancy. This undermines the council's assumption that building a stadium will cause economic revitalization.",

Without it, similarly situated individuals could receive vastly different legal outcomes depending on which judge hears their case. Since our legal system follows stare decisis, it treats all individuals fairly.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The scholar concludes that because the legal system follows stare decisis, it is fair. This conclusion only follows if following precedent is sufficient for fairness—that is, if it's the only requirement. If other factors are also necessary for fairness, then following stare decisis alone wouldn't guarantee a fair system.",

    stimulus: `Ethicists have long debated whether intentions or consequences should determine the moral worth of an action. However, this debate overlooks a crucial point: in practice, we cannot always know the consequences of our actions in advance. Since moral judgments must be possible before an action is taken, we must have some way to evaluate actions independently of their outcomes. This suggests that intentions play an irreducible role in moral evaluation.`,

    explanation: "The argument uses the premise that we cannot always know consequences in advance, combined with the claim that moral judgments must be possible beforehand, to conclude that intentions must play an irreducible (fundamental) role in moral evaluation. The other options are premises or intermediate conclusions supporting this main point.",

But this argument proves too much. By the same logic, we would have to conclude that young children do not understand language, since we cannot verify that they are conscious in the philosophically rigorous sense my colleague requires. Since we accept that children understand language, we should reconsider whether consciousness is truly necessary for understanding.`,

    explanation: "The professor uses a reductio ad absurdum approach: applying the colleague's reasoning consistently leads to the implausible conclusion that children don't understand language. Since we reject this conclusion, we should question the reasoning that leads to it. This is a classic method of showing an argument 'proves too much.'",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The nutritionist observes a correlation (breakfast eaters tend to have healthier weights) and concludes a causal relationship (breakfast prevents weight gain). However, the correlation might be explained by other factors—perhaps health-conscious people are more likely both to eat breakfast and to maintain healthy weights, without breakfast itself being the cause.",

    stimulus: `Marine biologists have observed that certain coral species are migrating to cooler waters as ocean temperatures rise. These corals have been found establishing new colonies at higher latitudes where they were previously absent. Scientists predict that this migration will allow these coral species to survive climate change by continuously relocating to suitable temperature zones.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the scientists' prediction?",

      { letter: "E", text: "Other marine species are also migrating to cooler waters" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "For coral migration to be a successful survival strategy, the corals must be able to thrive in their new locations. If the ocean floor at higher latitudes is suitable for coral attachment and growth, this supports the prediction that migration will allow survival. Without suitable substrate, the corals couldn't establish viable colonies in their new habitats.",

The company notes that this success rate is higher than the 55% success rate of the currently approved treatment, making the new drug a significant improvement in patient care.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the pharmaceutical company's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The new drug is significantly more expensive than the currently approved treatment" },

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If the trials excluded patients with common health conditions, the 70% success rate may not apply to the general patient population. The comparison with the current treatment's 55% rate becomes questionable if that rate was measured in a more representative population. The new drug might not actually be more effective when used by typical patients.",

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Employee turnover is primarily caused by insufficient training opportunities" },

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The analyst observes a correlation between training investment and lower turnover in other companies and concludes this company can achieve the same result. This assumes the correlation reflects causation (training causes lower turnover) and that this causal relationship would operate similarly in this company's context.",

Diana: Such requirements would have a chilling effect on free speech. Many people, including whistleblowers and political dissidents, rely on anonymity to safely express important views. The harm from silencing these voices outweighs the benefits of identity verification.`,

However, the mayor fails to mention that the city also raised parking fees downtown by 200% and reduced the number of available parking spaces during the same period. The transit system's increased ridership may simply reflect drivers being forced to find alternatives rather than any genuine appeal of the system.`,

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The critic suggests the transit system may lack 'genuine appeal' because ridership might be driven by parking difficulties rather than the system's merits. However, the argument provides no positive evidence that the system lacks appeal—it merely raises an alternative explanation for increased ridership.

    explanation: "Random assignment is the gold standard for establishing causation. If randomly assigned subjects (who had no initial differences from the control group) showed increased satisfaction after beginning gratitude exercises, this strongly supports a causal relationship.

This explanation assumes previous generations had similar career advancement goals—if older generations didn't seek advancement, the change in opportunities wouldn't explain the behavioral difference.",
