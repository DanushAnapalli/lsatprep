    stimulus: `Legal scholar: The right to free speech is fundamental in a democracy. However, speech that incites violence should not be protected. Since the controversial commentator's statements have been followed by violent incidents, it is clear that their speech should not be protected under free speech principles.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that what is legal is also moral" },
      { letter: "B", text: "conflates speech that is followed by violence with speech that incites violence" },
      { letter: "C", text: "fails to define what constitutes protected speech" },
      { letter: "D", text: "ignores the possibility that some violent speech should still be protected" },
      { letter: "E", text: "relies on an overly broad interpretation of democratic principles" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that because violence followed the speech, the speech incited the violence. However, correlation does not equal causation. Speech that happens to precede violence is not the same as speech that actually encourages or provokes violence. The commentator's statements might have been followed by violence for unrelated reasons.",

    stimulus: `Health researcher: Our study found that people who drink three or more cups of coffee per day live an average of two years longer than those who do not drink coffee. Therefore, drinking coffee extends lifespan.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "relies on a study that may have been conducted improperly" },

      { letter: "E", text: "generalizes from a sample to a population without justification" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the correlation-causation fallacy. Coffee drinkers might share other characteristics that explain their longer lifespan, such as higher socioeconomic status, better access to healthcare, or other healthy habits. The observed correlation does not establish that coffee itself causes longer life.",

    stimulus: `Political analyst: Senator Martinez voted against the veterans' benefits bill. Veterans' groups have expressed disappointment with this vote. Clearly, Senator Martinez does not support veterans, which explains why she lost significant support among veteran voters in the last election.`,
    questionStem: "A flaw in the argument is that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "uses the reaction of veterans' groups as evidence for the Senator's motivations" },

      { letter: "E", text: "relies on the opinions of interest groups rather than objective analysis" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument leaps from voting against a specific bill to not supporting veterans generally. A legislator might oppose a particular bill for many reasons: concerns about funding mechanisms, provisions unrelated to veterans, or preferring alternative legislation. Opposing one bill does not establish opposition to the broader cause.",

    stimulus: `Professor Williams argues that standardized testing accurately measures student knowledge. But Professor Williams works as a consultant for a major testing company and profits from the continued use of standardized tests. Therefore, standardized testing does not accurately measure student knowledge.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "attacks the source of an argument rather than the argument itself" },

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that financial interest always corrupts professional judgment" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "This is an ad hominem attack. The argument dismisses Professor Williams's claim by pointing to a potential conflict of interest rather than addressing the merits of the claim itself. Even if Williams has financial motivations, the claim about standardized testing could still be true or false on its own merits.",

    stimulus: `Economist: Countries with high minimum wages have higher unemployment rates than countries with lower minimum wages. This proves that raising the minimum wage causes unemployment to increase.`,
    questionStem: "The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It fails to define what constitutes a high minimum wage" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It does not consider that high minimum wages might be implemented in response to other economic conditions" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It relies on economic data that may be unreliable" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the post hoc fallacy and ignores reverse causation. Countries might raise minimum wages in response to strong economies that can sustain higher wages, or high minimum wages might correlate with other economic policies. The comparison across countries doesn't establish causation because many confounding variables exist.",

    questionStem: "The music critic's reasoning is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to provide criteria for what constitutes innovation in music" },

      { letter: "E", text: "conflates popularity with artistic quality" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The critic assumes that using traditional structures means the work cannot be innovative in any respect. However, innovation can occur in harmony, rhythm, instrumentation, or other elements even while incorporating traditional structures. Using some traditional elements does not preclude innovation in other aspects.",

    stimulus: `Environmental activist: The chemical plant claims that its emissions are safe because they meet government regulatory standards. But these standards were established decades ago and haven't been updated. Therefore, the plant's emissions are not safe.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that older standards are necessarily inadequate" },

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that government standards should be the sole measure of safety" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that because standards are old, they must be inadequate. However, old standards are not necessarily wrong or insufficient. The standards might have been conservative when established, or current scientific understanding might still support them. Age alone does not invalidate a standard.",

    stimulus: `Historian: Every major empire in history has eventually declined and fallen. The American influence in global affairs can be considered a modern empire. Therefore, American global influence will inevitably decline.`,
    questionStem: "The historian's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "relies on a questionable analogy between historical empires and modern global influence" },

      { letter: "E", text: "does not consider that some empires lasted for many centuries" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument commits the fallacy of assuming historical inevitability. While past empires have fallen, this does not logically necessitate that all future entities described as empires must follow the same pattern. Circumstances, technologies, and global structures change, and past patterns do not guarantee future outcomes.",

    stimulus: `Marketing director: Our competitor's new product has received negative reviews from several technology websites. This shows that their product is inferior, which means our marketing campaign emphasizing our product's quality will be successful.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that website reviews accurately reflect consumer preferences" },
      { letter: "B", text: "conflates a competitor's weakness with a guarantee of one's own success" },

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the possibility that the reviews may be biased" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that a competitor's problems guarantee one's own success. However, a marketing campaign's success depends on many factors beyond competitor weaknesses, including the quality of the campaign itself, consumer awareness, pricing, and market conditions. A competitor's failure does not ensure one's own triumph.",

But thousands of people were near the bank that day, and many people need money. The prosecution has failed to prove my client's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.`,
    questionStem: "The defense attorney's reasoning is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "attacks the prosecution's evidence without providing an alternative explanation" },

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores that circumstantial evidence can support a conviction" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The defense attorney only addresses two pieces of evidence (proximity and financial need) and may be creating a straw man by implying this is the prosecution's entire case. The prosecution may have additional evidence not mentioned, and dismissing only part of the case does not establish reasonable doubt about the entire case.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This establishes a mechanism connecting drought to civilizational decline. If the Harappan civilization depended on monsoon-fed agriculture, a prolonged drought would directly threaten their food supply and thus their survival, making climate change a plausible cause of their decline.",
