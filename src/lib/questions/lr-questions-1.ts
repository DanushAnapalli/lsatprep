    stimulus: `Mayor: Our city's new traffic light synchronization system has reduced average commute times by 15 percent. Since implementing this system cost only $2 million, and the economic value of time saved by commuters exceeds $10 million annually, the system has clearly been a wise investment that benefits everyone in the city.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The mayor concludes the system 'benefits everyone' but only demonstrates aggregate benefits. Non-drivers, those who don't commute, or those whose routes weren't affected may receive no benefit while potentially bearing costs through taxes.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that eating breakfast causes better performance. However, the correlation might be explained by other factors - perhaps families that provide breakfast also provide other academic support, or children who are well-rested are both more likely to eat breakfast and perform better.",

Modern artist Jana Kovacs also demonstrates exceptional use of light and shadow in her work. Therefore, Kovacs's paintings are as artistically significant as those of the Dutch Masters.`,

    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that the bill in question would actually improve education" },

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument commits a false dichotomy by assuming that opposing one particular bill means opposing the goal entirely. Someone could care deeply about children but oppose this specific bill due to concerns about implementation, funding sources, or believing alternative approaches would be more effective.",

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the possibility that customers of other brands are less likely to complain" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument fails to account for market share. If Brand X sells significantly more phones than competitors, it would naturally receive more complaints even if its quality were equal or superior. The relevant metric would be complaints as a percentage of units sold.",

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The pesticide has been shown in laboratory studies to impair bees' navigation abilities" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Bee populations in neighboring regions that don't use the pesticide have remained stable" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Other factors that might affect bee populations have remained constant in the region" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This provides a control comparison. If nearby regions without the pesticide have stable bee populations while this region's bees are declining, it strengthens the causal link between the pesticide and bee decline by ruling out regional environmental factors.",

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the economist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The program costs less per participant than similar programs in other countries" },

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This establishes a baseline comparison. Without knowing how many unemployed workers would have found jobs anyway, the 70% figure is meaningless. Showing that non-participants had only a 40% employment rate demonstrates the program's added value.",

    stimulus: `Archaeologist: The ancient city of Karthum was destroyed by an earthquake, not by invasion as previously believed. The ruins show a pattern of structural collapse consistent with seismic activity, and there are no signs of fire damage that would typically accompany a military attack.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the archaeologist's conclusion?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Historical records from neighboring civilizations make no mention of an invasion of Karthum" },

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Vegetables contain compounds that have been shown to reduce inflammation in blood vessels" },

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the curator's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The painting was purchased from a dealer known to have sold other forgeries" },

      { letter: "E", text: "The synthetic compound was commonly used by forgers in the mid-20th century" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This eliminates an alternative explanation. If the synthetic compound could have been introduced during later restoration, the painting might still be authentic. Ruling this out solidifies the conclusion that the painting must have been created after 1920.",

      { letter: "E", text: "The number of employees has increased by 10 percent over the same period" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This introduces an alternative explanation. If the company also introduced incentives for cross-departmental work at the same time, the increase in such projects might be due to the bonus system rather than the office layout change.",

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Both arguments make an initial disjunction, use elimination to reach a conclusion, then discover the original disjunction was incomplete (there was a third option not initially considered), invalidating the conclusion. This shows how incomplete disjunctions lead to flawed reasoning.",

    stimulus: `Principle: One should only criticize others for actions that one would not perform oneself in similar circumstances.\n\nApplication: Therefore, the senator was wrong to criticize the governor for accepting campaign donations from corporations.`,
    questionStem: "The application of the principle is most justified if which one of the following is true?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The senator has never run a campaign that required significant funding" },

      { letter: "E", text: "The senator and the governor are political rivals" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The principle prohibits criticizing others for actions you would do yourself. If the senator has accepted similar donations, criticizing the governor for the same action violates this principle, making the criticism 'wrong' as the application concludes.",
