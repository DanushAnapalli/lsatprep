    stimulus: `Professor Williams argues that standardized testing should be eliminated from college admissions because it disadvantages students from lower-income families who cannot afford expensive test preparation courses. However, Professor Williams himself benefited from standardized testing when he gained admission to a prestigious university thirty years ago. Therefore, his argument against standardized testing should be dismissed.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the ad hominem fallacy by attacking Professor Williams's personal history rather than addressing his actual argument about income-based disadvantages. The fact that Williams benefited from testing decades ago has no bearing on whether his current argument about socioeconomic disparities is valid. Choice A identifies a relevant consideration but does not describe the primary flaw. Choice C, D, and E describe potential weaknesses but not the central logical error of attacking the arguer rather than the argument.",

If the plan succeeds, businesses will thrive due to improved accessibility. If the plan fails, at least we will have learned valuable lessons for future planning efforts. Therefore, we cannot lose by implementing this plan.`,

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the views of those who would be affected by the plan" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument presents a false choice by suggesting that failure has no real downside beyond lessons learned. However, a failed traffic plan could waste substantial public funds, cause temporary disruptions, and create other negative consequences that far outweigh educational benefits. The argument assumes all outcomes are positive without considering the magnitude of potential costs. While C notes that partial success is ignored, the primary flaw is the dismissal of failure's true costs.",

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that all climate researchers have equal qualifications" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. While all committee members have published on climate change (necessary condition), publishing on climate change is not stated to be sufficient for membership. Many researchers outside the committee may also publish on this topic. The logical form is: All A are B; X is B; therefore X is A—which is invalid. Choice B touches on a related issue but the core flaw is the confusion of necessary and sufficient conditions.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument commits the classic post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy by assuming that because two trends occurred simultaneously, one must have caused the other. However, correlation does not establish causation. Many other factors could explain rising obesity rates—decreased physical activity, increased screen time, changes in school nutrition programs—that have nothing to do with fast-food proliferation. Without controlling for other variables, the causal claim is unfounded.",

    stimulus: `Historian: The widespread belief that medieval Europeans thought the Earth was flat is a modern myth. In fact, educated people in medieval times knew the Earth was spherical, as ancient Greek texts establishing this were widely available. Critics who claim this revisionist view whitewashes medieval ignorance are simply refusing to accept historical facts that contradict their preconceptions.`,

    explanation: "The historian commits an ad hominem by dismissing critics as biased rather than engaging with their actual arguments. Characterizing opponents as 'refusing to accept historical facts that contradict their preconceptions' attacks their motives rather than their reasoning. While D raises a valid point about the distinction between elites and common people, the primary logical flaw is the dismissal of criticism through character attack rather than substantive response.",

    stimulus: `Some philosophers argue that free will is an illusion because all human actions are determined by prior causes. But if that were true, then the philosophers making this argument were themselves determined to make it, which means they could not have chosen otherwise. Since we praise people for making sound arguments, which implies they could have done otherwise, the determinist position is self-refuting.`,

      { letter: "E", text: "It does not explain why we praise people for making sound arguments" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that determinism and meaningful choice are mutually exclusive, but many philosophers (compatibilists) argue that even if actions are causally determined, we can still meaningfully speak of choice and responsibility. The argument does not address this middle-ground position, which could dissolve the alleged self-refutation. While A and B identify related issues, C captures the most significant oversight in the argument's reasoning.",

    stimulus: `Public health official: The anti-vaccination movement has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases. When confronted with scientific evidence supporting vaccine safety, anti-vaccine advocates often shift to different objections or question the motives of researchers. This pattern of constantly moving goalposts demonstrates that their opposition is not based on genuine scientific concerns but on irrational fear.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that all members of a movement share identical reasoning patterns" },

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that official scientific consensus is never subject to legitimate revision" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that shifting to new objections must indicate bad faith, but this overlooks the possibility that new concerns could legitimately arise as new information becomes available. Someone could abandon one objection when refuted but raise a new valid objection based on emerging evidence. While the argument may be correct that some opponents argue in bad faith, the pattern described does not necessarily prove irrational fear—it could reflect genuine ongoing engagement with evolving science.",

      { letter: "E", text: "relies on data that may be outdated or unreliable" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits a causal direction error. While there is a correlation between education investment and GDP, the argument assumes education causes growth. However, the reverse could be true: wealthy countries may simply have more resources to invest in education. Without establishing the direction of causation, the recommendation may be unfounded. Additionally, D is relevant but the primary flaw is the causal direction ambiguity.",

    stimulus: `Art critic: True artistic genius cannot be taught; it must be innate. Every great artist in history possessed natural talent that no amount of training could have produced in someone lacking that gift. This is why art schools, despite their noble intentions, will never produce genuinely great artists.`,
    questionStem: "The argument is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It provides no evidence that all great artists lacked formal training" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It fails to define what constitutes artistic genius or greatness" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It overlooks artists who achieved greatness through persistent effort alone" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument presents a false dichotomy between innate talent and training, as if they were mutually exclusive. In reality, training might be necessary to develop and express innate potential. Many great artists had extensive training; their genius may have required both natural ability and cultivation. The argument's assumption that training adds nothing to innate talent oversimplifies the relationship between nature and nurture in artistic development.",

    stimulus: `Legal scholar: The justice system should prioritize rehabilitation over punishment because the recidivism rate for rehabilitated offenders is lower than for those who serve punitive sentences. My opponent argues that victims deserve to see offenders punished. But we must choose what works best for society, and rehabilitation reduces future crimes.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that rehabilitation and punishment are mutually exclusive approaches" },

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the deterrent effect of punishment on potential offenders" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument presents a false dichotomy by suggesting we must choose between rehabilitation and punishment. In reality, many justice systems incorporate both elements, and punitive consequences can coexist with rehabilitative programs. The scholar dismisses the opponent's concern about punishment without considering that a balanced approach might address both victim concerns and reduce recidivism. While C and E raise valid considerations, the core flaw is the false either/or framing.",

    stimulus: `Researchers found that employees who work from home report higher job satisfaction than those who work in traditional office settings. However, skeptics argue that this difference might be explained by selection effects: perhaps employees with more satisfying jobs to begin with are more likely to be offered remote work options. Nonetheless, the researchers maintain that remote work itself contributes to higher satisfaction.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researchers' position?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Employees who switched from remote work to office work reported decreased satisfaction after the switch" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Most employees prefer the option of working from home at least some days" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Choice A provides evidence that addresses the selection effect concern directly. If the same employees report decreased satisfaction after switching from remote to office work, this suggests the work arrangement itself—not pre-existing job characteristics—affects satisfaction. This before-and-after comparison within the same population helps isolate the causal effect of remote work. Choice B might explain why remote work increases satisfaction but doesn't address the skeptics' concern about selection effects.",

Some skeptics argue that coral reefs have survived past climate changes and will adapt. However, the current rate of acidification is unprecedented in geological history, suggesting that natural adaptation may not be possible.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the marine biologist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Coral species that survived past climate events did so over thousands of years" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Scientists have developed methods to artificially cultivate coral in laboratories" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The biologist's argument hinges on the unprecedented speed of current acidification. Choice A strengthens this by showing that past coral survival required long time periods—thousands of years—which are not available given the rapid pace of current changes. This directly supports the conclusion that natural adaptation may be impossible. Choice D is also supportive but less directly connected to coral specifically, while B actually somewhat weakens the argument.",

    stimulus: `Political scientist: Ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates in order of preference, leads to more moderate candidates being elected compared to traditional plurality voting. This is because candidates benefit from being voters' second choice, incentivizing them to appeal broadly rather than only to their base.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "In ranked-choice elections, voter turnout tends to be higher than in plurality elections" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Political parties in ranked-choice systems have developed new campaign strategies" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Choice B strengthens the argument by providing evidence of the behavioral mechanism the argument describes. If candidates are incentivized to appeal broadly to gain second-choice votes, we would expect them to avoid negative advertising that might alienate potential second-choice supporters. The decrease in negative advertising is consistent with candidates seeking broad appeal. Choice D might seem directly supportive but doesn't address the mechanism—the 'why'—as effectively as B does.",

The body adjusts its own cholesterol production in response to dietary intake, maintaining relatively stable blood cholesterol levels regardless of egg consumption.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the nutritionist's argument?",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Choice B directly supports the compensatory mechanism the nutritionist describes. If the liver reduces its cholesterol production when dietary intake increases, this explains why blood cholesterol levels remain stable despite eating eggs. This provides the biological evidence for the body's regulatory adjustment. Choice A is vague about what factors matter, while C changes the topic to other nutritional benefits.",

The desire for meaningful occupation and the aspiration for income beyond basic needs will continue to motivate employment even when basic necessities are guaranteed.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the economist's argument?",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Choice B provides strong analogical evidence. Lottery winners, like UBI recipients, receive money without working for it. If these winners continue working at similar rates, this suggests that unconditional income does not eliminate work motivation—directly supporting the economist's claim. Choice E is also supportive but less directly applicable since existing safety nets typically have conditions unlike UBI. Choice D partially addresses the concern but doesn't speak to underlying motivation.",

    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument concludes that artifact diversity indicates trade connections. Choice D strengthens this by ruling out an alternative explanation—that the artifacts arrived through warfare or theft rather than trade. If the archaeological context indicates trade goods (e.g., commercial storage areas, merchant quarters), the trade-route conclusion is more secure. Choice B strengthens uniqueness but doesn't confirm the trade mechanism; A supports but doesn't prove trade over alternatives.",

    explanation: "The psychologist argues that lasting benefits prove effects are not merely placebo. Choice D directly supports this reasoning by establishing that placebo effects typically fade quickly. If meditation benefits persist for months while placebo effects normally diminish within weeks, this distinguishes meditation from placebo.

    explanation: "Choice C weakens the argument by suggesting the success in other cities may not transfer to this city. If those cities had higher population densities, which typically correlate with higher transit ridership, then the same results may not occur in this lower-density city. The analogy to other cities' success becomes questionable when key conditions differ. Choice A and D raise concerns but don't directly challenge the analogy that forms the argument's foundation.",

    explanation: "The scientist argues that the critics are using the wrong criteria to judge the models. Climate models are designed for long-term trends, not short-term predictions, so evaluating them by short-term accuracy is an inappropriate standard. The map analogy reinforces this point—maps and climate models should be judged by their intended purposes. This is a response that challenges the evaluation criteria rather than disputing the facts.",
