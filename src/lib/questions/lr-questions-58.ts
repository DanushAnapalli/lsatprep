    stimulus: `Corporate executives argue that increased regulation of their industry would harm consumers by raising prices. However, these same executives consistently lobby against any measures that would increase competition in their markets. Clearly, their opposition to regulation is motivated purely by self-interest rather than concern for consumers.`,

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument commits the flaw of assuming that because executives have a self-interested reason for opposing regulation, this must be their only reason. The presence of one motive does not preclude the existence of other, legitimate motives.",

    stimulus: `Philosopher: Some people argue that we have no free will because all our actions are determined by prior causes. But this argument is self-defeating. If we have no free will, then the person making this argument was determined to make it, and we were determined to either accept or reject it. So the argument cannot rationally persuade anyone.`,
