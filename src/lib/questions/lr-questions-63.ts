    stimulus: `A recent study found that employees who take regular breaks throughout the workday are more productive than those who work continuously. Therefore, companies should require all employees to take mandatory breaks every hour, as this will certainly increase overall productivity.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that mandating breaks will have the same positive effect as voluntarily taking breaks. However, the study was about employees who choose to take breaks, not those who are forced to. The effectiveness of breaks may depend on employee autonomy and personal work rhythms.",

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument commits an appeal to authority fallacy. While Dr. Harrison is experienced, her skepticism alone does not constitute evidence against the treatment's effectiveness. The argument should present actual data or research about the treatment rather than relying solely on one expert's opinion.",

Councilwoman Martinez voted for the regulations. Therefore, she must have received contributions from developers and her vote was influenced by those contributions.`,

    correctAnswer: "E",
    explanation: "The argument makes two questionable leaps: first, it assumes Martinez received developer contributions (which follows from the premise), but more critically, it assumes that receiving contributions necessarily means her vote was influenced by them. A council member could receive contributions and still vote based on genuine policy beliefs.",

This theory is supported by genetic evidence showing that modern humans have remarkably low genetic diversity compared to other primate species, suggesting a population bottleneck occurred.`,

    explanation: "If genetic analysis independently dates the population bottleneck to the same time period as the volcanic eruption (70,000-75,000 years ago), this provides strong corroborating evidence that the eruption caused the population reduction. The timing alignment makes the causal connection more plausible.",

      { letter: "E", text: "Similar bike-sharing programs in other cities have also increased cycling rates" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If the city also completed new protected bike lanes and launched a safety campaign during the same period, these alternative factors could explain the increase in cyclists. This weakens the claim that the bike-sharing program is responsible for the increase, as other initiatives may have contributed significantly to the change.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This answer suggests reverse causation: high-performing students may be more likely to join extracurricular activities (perhaps because they have better time management or more parental support), rather than activities causing high performance. If this is true, expanding programs wouldn't necessarily improve grades for students who currently don't participate.",

    explanation: "The argument moves from general public interest in Egyptian history to a prediction about specific exhibit attendance. This assumes that people's stated interest in a topic will translate into actual museum visits for an exhibit on that topic.

Some argue that moral facts exist independently of human beliefs, while others maintain that morality is entirely constructed by societies.

However, publishers also provide editing, marketing, design, advances, and industry connections. If these services are valuable, publishers may still be 'necessary' even if distribution is available through other means.",

Professor Blake: Moral principles like human equality and dignity are not inventions of our time. Slavery, for example, was criticized by thoughtful people throughout history. We can and should judge historical figures by moral standards that were available to them.`,
