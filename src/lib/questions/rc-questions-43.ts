// PASSAGE 1: Universal Basic Income
const passage1 = `Universal Basic Income (UBI)—a government program providing all citizens with regular, unconditional cash payments—has moved from the margins of policy discourse to mainstream debate. Advocates argue that UBI could address multiple challenges facing contemporary economies: technological unemployment as automation displaces workers, the inadequacy of existing welfare programs, the stigma associated with means-tested benefits, and the precarity of gig economy employment. By providing everyone with a guaranteed income floor, UBI would enable people to pursue education, entrepreneurship, or caregiving without fear of destitution, potentially unleashing human creativity and productivity currently suppressed by economic insecurity.

Proponents emphasize UBI's potential to simplify the welfare state. Current social assistance programs are typically complex, bureaucratic, and means-tested, requiring recipients to prove eligibility through intrusive documentation and creating perverse incentives. If benefits phase out as recipients earn income, individuals may face effective marginal tax rates exceeding 100 percent—earning an additional dollar of income costs more than a dollar in lost benefits, creating "welfare traps" that discourage work. UBI, being unconditional and universal, would eliminate these problems. It would reduce administrative costs, remove stigma, and avoid poverty traps by ensuring that earned income always increases total resources.

However, critics raise several objections. First, the fiscal cost of providing genuinely adequate payments to all citizens would be enormous. A UBI of $12,000 per year for 250 million American adults would cost $3 trillion annually—approximately 15 percent of GDP and more than current total federal spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid combined. Financing such a program would require either massive tax increases, elimination of existing social programs, or unsustainable deficits. Defenders respond that much of the cost represents transfers rather than consumption—the money would be recirculated through the economy—and that replacing existing programs while consolidating tax and transfer systems could partially offset costs.

Second, critics question whether unconditional payments would reduce labor force participation, leading to economic inefficiency and undermining the social value of work. While proponents argue that UBI would free people to pursue worthwhile activities currently uncompensated by markets, critics worry that many would simply work less without engaging in socially valuable alternatives. Empirical evidence from UBI experiments is mixed and contested. Studies of pilot programs in Finland, Kenya, and Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend show varied effects on employment, with some studies finding little impact and others showing reduced work hours. However, these programs typically provide relatively modest payments, and their short-term nature may not reveal long-run behavioral changes.

Third, some progressives argue that UBI is an inefficient and politically problematic approach to poverty reduction. They note that universal programs necessarily spend substantial resources on non-poor recipients who do not need assistance. Targeted programs, despite their complexity, can concentrate resources on those most in need. Moreover, they worry that UBI would undermine political support for robust social insurance by commodifying welfare—reducing social provision to cash payments rather than guarantees of healthcare, education, housing, and other specific goods. This could make the welfare state more vulnerable to erosion, as a cash benefit is more easily cut than a program providing specific services that create organized constituencies. The debate over UBI thus reflects deeper disagreements about the welfare state's goals, the proper balance between universality and targeting, and whether social provision should emphasize individual choice through cash transfers or collective provision of specific goods and services.`;

// PASSAGE 2: Carbon Pricing and Climate Policy
const passage2 = `Carbon pricing—imposing costs on greenhouse gas emissions through taxes or cap-and-trade systems—is widely endorsed by economists as an efficient approach to reducing emissions. By putting a price on carbon, these policies create incentives for businesses and individuals to reduce emissions wherever doing so costs less than the carbon price, theoretically achieving emission reductions at the lowest possible cost. A carbon tax directly sets the price per ton of emissions, while cap-and-trade systems set an emissions limit and allow permits to be traded, letting the market determine the price. Despite theoretical elegance, carbon pricing faces significant practical and political challenges.

The economic case for carbon pricing rests on correcting a market failure: greenhouse gas emissions impose costs on society that emitters do not bear, leading to excessive pollution. Setting an appropriate carbon price internalizes these external costs, aligning private incentives with social welfare. Unlike regulatory approaches that mandate specific technologies or practices, carbon pricing allows flexibility—firms can reduce emissions, switch to cleaner energy, purchase offsets, or pay the carbon price, choosing whichever option costs least. This flexibility theoretically minimizes the total cost of achieving any given emission reduction, compared to command-and-control regulations that may require expensive changes even when cheaper alternatives exist.

However, determining the appropriate price is technically and politically contentious. The "social cost of carbon"—the present value of future damages from an additional ton of emissions—depends on uncertain climate models, discount rates applied to future damages, and ethical judgments about weighing costs to future generations. Estimates range from under $10 to over $400 per ton depending on assumptions. Furthermore, unilateral carbon pricing by one jurisdiction creates competitiveness concerns: energy-intensive industries might relocate to jurisdictions without carbon pricing ("carbon leakage"), reducing environmental benefits while harming the domestic economy. This creates pressure to exempt trade-exposed industries, undermining the policy's coverage and effectiveness.

Political opposition to carbon pricing has proven formidable. Visible energy price increases generate public backlash, as France's Yellow Vest protests against fuel tax increases demonstrated. The policy tends to be regressive, imposing larger burdens as a percentage of income on poor households, who spend larger shares of income on energy. While economists advocate using carbon tax revenues for progressive redistribution, the political coalition needed to enact carbon pricing may not support such redistribution, and revenue recycling through tax cuts for other groups may be necessary to secure political support, limiting funds available for addressing regressivity or other climate investments.

Some environmentalists argue that carbon pricing's economic efficiency advantages are overstated and that regulatory approaches may be more effective. They note that market failures beyond external costs—including information asymmetries, principal-agent problems, and behavioral biases—prevent optimal responses to price signals. Landlords, for example, may not invest in energy efficiency even when carbon prices make such investments cost-effective, because tenants pay energy bills. Behavioral economics research suggests that people respond to salient regulations and standards more readily than to diffuse price signals. Moreover, critics argue, carbon pricing alone cannot drive the transformative infrastructure changes needed for deep decarbonization. Achieving net-zero emissions requires coordinated public investment in clean energy research, transmission infrastructure, and industrial transformation that carbon pricing alone cannot motivate. The debate reflects not only technical questions about policy effectiveness but also deeper disagreements about markets' capacity to address complex collective action problems and whether efficiency should be prioritized over other values like equity, political feasibility, and the scope for democratic control over energy transitions.`;

// PASSAGE 3: Education Reform and School Choice
const passage3 = `School choice policies—including charter schools, voucher programs, and open enrollment systems—aim to improve education by introducing market-like competition. The theory holds that when families can choose among schools, schools must compete for students, creating incentives to improve quality. Poor-performing schools would lose students and funding, pressuring them to improve or close, while successful schools would attract more students and resources. This competitive dynamic would raise overall educational quality without requiring top-down mandates about curriculum or pedagogy. Proponents also emphasize that school choice promotes equity by enabling low-income families to access options previously available only to wealthy families who could afford private schools or expensive housing in high-performing school districts.

Charter schools—publicly funded but independently operated schools freed from many district regulations—represent the most widespread form of school choice. Research on charter school effectiveness yields mixed results. Some studies find that urban charter schools, particularly those in networks like KIPP or Success Academy, produce substantial learning gains for disadvantaged students. However, other research shows many charter schools perform no better than traditional public schools, and some perform worse. The variation suggests that charter status itself matters less than specific practices and management, and that weak charter authorization and oversight can allow low-quality schools to persist.

Critics raise several concerns about school choice. First, empirical evidence on competitive effects is disappointing. While theory predicts that competition improves all schools, studies find limited evidence that traditional public schools improve when facing charter competition. This may reflect insufficient competitive pressure—charter schools typically enroll small shares of students in most districts—or the difficulty of improving schools quickly even when competition exists. Second, school choice may increase segregation by race and class. When families choose schools, they often prefer schools where their children will be surrounded by similar peers, and schools have incentives to attract high-achieving, low-cost students while avoiding students with disabilities or behavioral problems. Some studies document increased segregation in choice systems, though others find mixed effects depending on program design.

Third, critics argue that school choice undermines democratic governance of education. Traditional public schools are governed by elected school boards accountable to local communities. Charter schools, by contrast, are typically governed by appointed boards of private organizations. While charter schools are nominally public and subject to some accountability measures, critics argue that they lack the transparency and democratic control of traditional public schools. Decisions about curriculum, discipline, and resource allocation are made by private boards not directly accountable to voters, potentially insulating education policy from democratic input. Defenders respond that parental choice itself provides accountability—schools that fail to satisfy parents lose students—and that bureaucratic accountability through school boards often serves employee interests rather than students.

The debate also reflects different conceptions of education's social purposes. One view sees education primarily as a private good benefiting individual students, whose families should control educational choices. This perspective naturally supports school choice as empowering families. An alternative view sees education as a public good that serves broader social functions: fostering civic values, promoting social integration, and equalizing opportunities. From this perspective, market-like competition may undermine education's civic purposes by encouraging schools to differentiate themselves and families to sort by preferences, fragmenting rather than integrating communities. Whether school choice improves educational outcomes may matter less than whether it advances or undermines these broader social goals—a question requiring normative judgments that empirical research alone cannot resolve. The persistence of the school choice debate despite decades of research partly reflects these underlying value disagreements about education's purposes and governance.`;

// PASSAGE 4: Electoral System Reform
const passage4 = `The United States employs single-member district plurality (SMDP) voting—commonly called "first past the post"—in which each district elects one representative, and the candidate receiving the most votes wins, even without a majority. This system, inherited from British colonial practice, is nearly universal in American federal and state elections. However, political scientists have long critiqued SMDP for producing problematic outcomes: discouraging third parties, creating "wasted votes," enabling gerrymandering, and potentially electing candidates opposed by majorities. These concerns have sparked interest in alternative electoral systems, though reform faces both theoretical complexities and practical obstacles.

The case against SMDP rests on several effects. First, the system strongly disadvantages third parties and independent candidates. A party winning 20 percent of votes nationally but lacking geographic concentration might win no seats. This creates a "spoiler" dynamic: voters who prefer third-party candidates often vote strategically for major-party candidates to avoid "wasting" votes or inadvertently helping their least-preferred major candidate. These dynamics produce Duverger's Law—the empirical observation that SMDP systems tend toward two-party dominance. Second, SMDP enables gerrymandering: because victories depend on winning pluralities in specific districts rather than overall vote shares, party controlling redistricting can manipulate district boundaries to maximize its seat share, sometimes winning legislative majorities with minority vote shares.

Proportional representation (PR) systems address these problems by allocating seats to parties based on their vote shares. In a pure PR system, a party winning 30 percent of votes receives approximately 30 percent of seats. This eliminates wasted votes, removes incentives for strategic voting, and enables multiple parties to win representation. However, PR systems create different challenges. By facilitating multiple parties, PR often produces fragmented legislatures requiring coalition governments. Coalition formation can be opaque, occurring through post-election negotiations rather than voter choice, and coalitions may include small parties wielding disproportionate influence. Some argue that single-party governments produced by SMDP provide clearer accountability—voters can reward or punish the governing party—while coalition governments diffuse responsibility.

Ranked-choice voting (RCV), also called instant-runoff voting, offers a different reform. Voters rank candidates by preference; if no candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, the last-place candidate is eliminated and their votes redistributed to voters' second choices, continuing until someone achieves a majority. RCV's proponents argue it reduces strategic voting, enables third-party candidacies without spoiler effects, and ensures winners have majority support. However, RCV has its own complexities. The system can produce non-monotonic results—adding support for a candidate can paradoxically cause them to lose—and determining winners requires centralized counting, making results less transparent than simple plurality. Moreover, RCV retains single-member districts, failing to address proportionality concerns.

The practical politics of electoral reform are daunting. Politicians elected under existing systems have obvious incentives to oppose reforms that might threaten their positions. Constitutional and legal constraints limit reform possibilities—the Constitution mandates single-member House districts. Public understanding of alternative systems is limited, making it difficult to build reform coalitions. When reforms have been adopted, implementation challenges arise: ballot design complexity, voter education needs, and technological requirements for tabulation. Some jurisdictions have repealed reforms after brief experiments, citing implementation difficulties or dissatisfaction with results. Perhaps most fundamentally, no electoral system is objectively best. Arrow's Impossibility Theorem demonstrates that no voting system can satisfy all reasonable fairness criteria simultaneously. Different systems embody different tradeoffs between values like proportionality, governmental stability, local representation, and majority rule. Electoral system choice thus requires normative judgments about which values to prioritize, not merely technical assessments of which system "works best." The debate over electoral reform reflects not only disagreements about current systems' deficiencies but also deeper conflicts about democracy's purposes and proper functioning.`;

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The author presents both sides' arguments throughout, and concludes that the debate 'partly reflects these underlying value disagreements about education's purposes and governance' and involves 'normative judgments that empirical research alone cannot resolve.' This recognition of fundamental value questions beyond empirical evidence matches option C's description.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The passage critiques SMDP (paragraphs 1-2), discusses proportional representation's benefits and challenges (paragraph 3), examines ranked-choice voting (paragraph 4), and analyzes practical politics and fundamental tradeoffs citing Arrow's theorem (paragraph 5). This structure supports option B's description of critiques, complexities, obstacles, and lack of objective optimum.",

    explanation: "Duverger's Law appears in paragraph 2 after discussing how SMDP 'strongly disadvantages third parties' and creates strategic voting, described as 'the empirical observation that SMDP systems tend toward two-party dominance.' This uses the law to illustrate SMDP's effects on party systems, matching option B.",

While PR creates coalition governance challenges, proponents would emphasize these representational benefits.

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Paragraph 5 states: 'Arrow's Impossibility Theorem demonstrates that no voting system can satisfy all reasonable fairness criteria simultaneously. Different systems embody different tradeoffs between values.'
