      { letter: "E", text: "The dinosaurs were declining before the extinction event" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "A global iridium layer precisely at the extinction boundary strongly supports a single, worldwide catastrophic event like an asteroid impact. This rules out localized explanations and tightly links the iridium evidence to the extinction timing.",
