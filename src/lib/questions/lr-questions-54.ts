    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument commits the flaw of assuming that voluntary behavior will produce the same results when mandated. Employees who choose to take breaks may be fundamentally different from those who do not, or the act of choosing when to take breaks may itself contribute to productivity gains.",

Attorney Rivera: Courts must consider the purpose behind laws when interpreting them. Literal readings can lead to absurd results that legislators never intended.
