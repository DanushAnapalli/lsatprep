    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the correlation-causation fallacy. Just because students who listen to classical music score higher does not mean the music caused the improvement. There could be other factors at play, such as the type of students who choose to listen to classical music being more academically inclined to begin with.",

    stimulus: `Professor Martinez argues that the university should eliminate its foreign language requirement because many successful business leaders never studied a foreign language in college. However, Professor Martinez himself majored in French literature, so his argument against the requirement is clearly self-serving and should be dismissed.`,

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "This is an ad hominem fallacy. The argument dismisses Professor Martinez's position by attacking his personal background rather than engaging with the substance of his argument about the foreign language requirement. The fact that he studied French literature does not automatically invalidate his argument.",

They point out that honeybee populations began declining shortly after these pesticides were introduced and that laboratory studies show these chemicals impair bee navigation and foraging abilities.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If regions that banned neonicotinoids saw bee populations stabilize or increase, this provides direct evidence supporting the causal claim that these pesticides are responsible for the decline. This is essentially a natural experiment showing that removing the proposed cause reverses the effect.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument ignores the relevant historical context. Women were systematically excluded from education and philosophical discourse throughout much of history. The lack of recognized female philosophers reflects these barriers, not inherent capability.

Patients who took the drug reported a 40% reduction in pain levels compared to those who took a placebo.

But the council recently approved funding for a new fountain in the town square. If the town can afford a fountain, it can certainly afford a community center.

    explanation: "The argument assumes that what happened in other countries will happen here. This requires assuming that the relevant conditions are sufficiently similar. If our country's economic situation differs substantially from countries that benefited from past agreements, the historical data may not be applicable.",
