    stimulus: `Scientist: The pharmaceutical company claims its new drug is safe because clinical trials showed no serious side effects. However, the trials only lasted three months, and the company has a financial interest in the drug's approval. Therefore, we cannot trust their claim that the drug is safe.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the scientist's argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that longer clinical trials would necessarily reveal more side effects" },

      { letter: "E", text: "confuses the absence of evidence for side effects with evidence that there are no side effects" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The scientist commits the genetic fallacy by dismissing the trial results based on the company's financial interest rather than examining the actual evidence from the trials. While the short duration is a legitimate concern, the argument primarily relies on impugning the source rather than addressing the data.",

    stimulus: `Political analyst: The proposed tax reform will not benefit the middle class. Every previous tax reform that claimed to help the middle class actually ended up benefiting primarily the wealthy. This proposal makes similar claims, so it will likely have the same outcome.`,

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that all tax reforms are designed with similar goals" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the fallacy of hasty generalization by assuming that because previous reforms with similar claims failed, this one must also fail. It doesn't examine the specific mechanisms of the current proposal, which might differ in ways that would produce different outcomes.",

    stimulus: `Ethics professor: Some argue that capital punishment is morally wrong because innocent people have been executed. But this argument proves too much. If we applied the same logic, we would have to abolish prisons because innocent people have been wrongly imprisoned. Since no one seriously proposes abolishing prisons, the argument against capital punishment fails.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument treats imprisonment and execution as equivalent, but they differ in a morally crucial way: wrongful imprisonment can be partially remedied through release and compensation, while execution is irreversible. This difference makes the risk of error more significant for capital punishment.",

    explanation: "The critic assumes that because the chef trained in French schools and never lived in Italy, they couldn't have learned authentic Italian cooking. This overlooks other ways to learn, such as mentorship from Italian chefs, self-study, or extensive work in Italian restaurants.",

They use celebrity endorsements, and studies show that consumers often mistakenly believe celebrities are experts on the products they endorse. Any advertising practice that exploits consumer misconceptions is unethical.`,

    stimulus: `Sociologist: Violent video games do not cause violent behavior in children. My research followed 500 children who regularly played violent video games, and none of them exhibited violent behavior at school. This conclusively proves that concerns about video game violence are unfounded.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The study of 500 children may not be representative of all children. Selection factors, such as which parents allow violent games or which children choose to play them, could mean this sample differs systematically from children generally. The absence of violence in this group doesn't prove no causal relationship exists.",

    questionStem: "The legal scholar's reasoning is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?",

      { letter: "E", text: "It presumes that all forms of transportation travel at the same speed" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument states the defendant was 'seen' at the restaurant at 7 PM, but this doesn't mean she was there until 7 PM. She could have been seen there and then left well before 7 PM, giving her ample time to travel 30 miles. The argument conflates being observed at a location with being at that location until a specific time.",

    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "presents an extreme scenario without evidence of its likelihood" },

    explanation: "The argument commits an ad hominem fallacy by claiming opponents 'don't care about protecting the environment' rather than engaging with their actual reasons for opposition. Someone might oppose an immediate total ban while still caring about the environment, perhaps preferring alternative approaches.",

    stimulus: `University dean: Our new core curriculum emphasizing practical skills will better prepare students for careers. Employers consistently report that recent graduates lack practical abilities. Since our curriculum now focuses on these skills, our graduates will be more employable than those from universities with traditional curricula.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the dean's reasoning?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that all employers value the same practical skills" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It overlooks that traditional curricula may also develop practical skills" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It presumes that employer opinions about graduates reflect actual graduate abilities" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The dean assumes that because the curriculum 'focuses on' practical skills, it will successfully develop them. However, simply emphasizing something in a curriculum doesn't guarantee students will acquire those abilities. The argument conflates curricular intent with educational outcome.",

    stimulus: `Historian: The ancient Egyptians could not have built the pyramids using only the technology available to them. The precision of the stonework and the scale of construction would have been impossible without advanced machinery. Therefore, they must have had help from a more technologically advanced civilization.`,
    questionStem: "The historian's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "presents a false dichotomy between primitive and advanced technology" },

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that the only way to achieve such precision and scale is through advanced machinery. This underestimates the capabilities of organized labor, mathematical knowledge, simple but effective tools, and centuries of accumulated expertise. Archaeological evidence actually shows how the pyramids were built with available technology.",

    stimulus: `Marine biologist: The decline in sea otter populations along the California coast is likely caused by increased predation by great white sharks. We have observed a significant increase in shark attacks on otters in recent years, and the areas with the steepest otter declines are those with the highest shark activity.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Great white sharks have been observed feeding on sea otters in areas where otter populations are stable" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Sea otter populations in areas with low shark activity have remained stable during the same period" },
      { letter: "C", text: "The great white shark population has increased substantially in recent decades" },

      { letter: "E", text: "The decline in sea otters has negatively affected kelp forest ecosystems" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This provides a control group comparison. If otter populations are stable where shark activity is low but declining where it's high, this strengthens the causal connection between shark predation and otter decline by ruling out other factors that would affect all otter populations equally.",

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the economist's conclusion?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Many companies have reduced their office space since adopting remote work policies" },
