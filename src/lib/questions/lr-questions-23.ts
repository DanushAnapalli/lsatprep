    stimulus: `Legal scholar: The proposed legislation would require all criminal defendants to prove their innocence. Proponents argue this would increase conviction rates for guilty individuals. However, in our legal system, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution precisely because it is nearly impossible to prove a negative—one cannot definitively prove that something did not happen.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that what is difficult is impossible" },

      { letter: "E", text: "relies on tradition as the sole justification for maintaining current practices" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The scholar claims it is 'nearly impossible to prove a negative' but treats this as if it were actually impossible. While proving a negative may be difficult in many cases, it is not literally impossible—alibis, for instance, can prove someone was not at a crime scene. The argument overstates the difficulty.",

    stimulus: `Historian: The ancient Mayans developed a sophisticated calendar system that accurately predicted astronomical events. Since modern scientists also use sophisticated methods to predict astronomical events, the Mayans must have possessed scientific knowledge equivalent to that of modern astronomers.`,
    questionStem: "The historian's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "ignores the possibility that the Mayans made astronomical predictions through trial and error rather than theoretical understanding" },

      { letter: "E", text: "confuses the ability to make predictions with the ability to explain the underlying phenomena" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The historian assumes that because both the Mayans and modern scientists achieve similar outcomes (accurate astronomical predictions), they must possess equivalent knowledge. However, the same result can be achieved through entirely different methods—the Mayans could have developed their calendar through centuries of observation and pattern recognition without understanding the scientific principles modern astronomers use.",

    stimulus: `Music critic: This composer's symphonies lack the emotional depth found in works by the great Romantic composers. The great Romantic composers all suffered personal tragedies that informed their work. Therefore, this composer's work lacks emotional depth because she has lived a happy and uneventful life.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "draws a conclusion about an individual based solely on characteristics of a group" },
      { letter: "B", text: "infers that because one thing preceded another, the first caused the second" },

      { letter: "E", text: "fails to consider whether the composer's work might gain emotional depth in the future" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that because great Romantic composers experienced tragedy and created emotionally deep work, tragedy is necessary for emotional depth. This is a faulty generalization—the correlation between tragedy and depth in those composers does not establish that tragedy is required. Artists can create emotionally profound work through imagination, empathy, and craft without personal suffering.",

    stimulus: `Financial advisor: Investing in index funds is the safest approach for retirement savings. After all, Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, has recommended index funds for average investors. If index funds are good enough for Warren Buffett's advice, they should be good enough for anyone.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that what is suitable for average investors is suitable for all investors" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It does not consider whether Buffett follows his own investment advice" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument rests entirely on Buffett's recommendation rather than examining why index funds might be safe or appropriate. While Buffett is a successful investor, the argument should evaluate the actual merits of index funds—their diversification, low fees, historical returns—rather than simply deferring to authority.",

    stimulus: `Ethicist: Animal testing for cosmetics is morally wrong because it causes suffering to sentient beings for trivial purposes. Some argue that animal testing has led to safer cosmetics for humans. But this argument fails because it assumes human interests always outweigh animal interests, which is the very point in dispute.`,
    questionStem: "The ethicist's reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "characterizes cosmetics as serving only trivial purposes without adequate justification" },

      { letter: "E", text: "equates the interests of all animal species with those of humans" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The ethicist dismisses the opposing argument by claiming it 'assumes human interests always outweigh animal interests.' However, the opposing argument might be more nuanced—it could argue that in some specific cases, significant human safety benefits justify limited animal harm. By characterizing it as begging the question without engaging with the substance, the ethicist avoids addressing the actual trade-offs involved.",

    stimulus: `Political analyst: The governor's approval rating has dropped from 62 percent to 48 percent since the new tax policy was implemented. Clearly, voters disapprove of the tax policy, and the governor should reverse course if she wants to win reelection.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the analyst's reasoning?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that approval ratings directly translate to election outcomes" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It fails to consider that multiple factors may have contributed to the change in approval ratings" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It presumes that the governor's primary goal is reelection rather than good policy" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The analyst attributes the entire drop in approval to the tax policy, but many factors could affect approval ratings—economic conditions, scandals, national political trends, or other policies. Without controlling for these variables, the conclusion that the tax policy caused the decline is unwarranted.",

    stimulus: `Defense attorney: The prosecution claims my client embezzled funds because she had access to the accounts and was experiencing financial difficulties at the time the embezzlement occurred. But millions of employees have access to company funds and experience financial difficulties without resorting to theft. The evidence is purely circumstantial.`,
    questionStem: "The defense attorney's argument is flawed in that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "misrepresents the prosecution's argument by suggesting it relies solely on access and motive" },
      { letter: "B", text: "assumes that circumstantial evidence can never be sufficient for a conviction" },

      { letter: "E", text: "attacks the strength of evidence without addressing whether the client is actually innocent" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The attorney dismisses the evidence as 'purely circumstantial' as if this alone invalidates it. However, circumstantial evidence can be compelling when multiple pieces converge to point to the same conclusion. Many convictions rest on circumstantial evidence, and the fact that many people with similar circumstances don't commit crimes doesn't mean this particular person didn't.",

    stimulus: `Nutritionist: People who eat breakfast tend to weigh less than those who skip it. Some claim this is because eating breakfast boosts metabolism. But studies show that people who eat breakfast also tend to exercise more and eat fewer late-night snacks. Therefore, eating breakfast does not actually help with weight management.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "concludes that breakfast has no effect based merely on the existence of confounding variables" },
      { letter: "B", text: "fails to consider that breakfast might indirectly cause the other healthy behaviors" },

      { letter: "D", text: "overlooks the possibility that different types of breakfast have different effects" },
      { letter: "E", text: "relies on studies without specifying their methodology or sample sizes" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The nutritionist notes that breakfast eaters also exercise more and snack less, then concludes breakfast doesn't help with weight management. But the argument fails to consider that eating breakfast might cause these other behaviors—perhaps breakfast provides energy for morning exercise or prevents hunger that leads to late-night snacking. If so, breakfast does help weight management, just indirectly.",

    stimulus: `School board member: We should not adopt the new mathematics curriculum because it was developed by a committee that included several members who profit from selling educational materials. Their financial interests compromise the objectivity of their recommendations.`,
    questionStem: "The school board member's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "rejects a proposal based on the motives of some of its developers rather than its actual merits" },
      { letter: "B", text: "assumes that all committee members had financial interests in the curriculum" },

      { letter: "E", text: "does not establish that the committee members' products are included in the curriculum" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "This is an ad hominem attack—the argument dismisses the curriculum based on the alleged motives of some developers rather than examining the curriculum's actual educational value. Even if some committee members had conflicts of interest, the curriculum could still be pedagogically sound. The argument should address the content, not the creators.",

    stimulus: `Consumer advocate: The automobile manufacturer claims its vehicles are safe, but this claim cannot be trusted. The company has a financial interest in convincing consumers that its cars are safe, and therefore any safety data it provides is inherently unreliable.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the consumer advocate's argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that safety data must be obtained from sources with no financial interest" },
      { letter: "B", text: "fails to consider that the company's safety data might be verified by independent testing" },
      { letter: "C", text: "treats the presence of a financial interest as sufficient to establish that information is false" },

      { letter: "E", text: "presumes that consumer advocates have no biases of their own" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The advocate assumes that because the company has a financial interest in appearing safe, its safety claims must be unreliable. However, having an interest in a particular outcome does not mean the information provided is actually false. The company's data could be accurate despite its financial interest, especially if subject to regulatory oversight or independent verification.",

    stimulus: `Psychologist: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective than medication alone for treating moderate depression. In a recent study, patients who received CBT showed greater improvement in depression symptoms and had lower relapse rates six months after treatment ended compared to patients who only took antidepressants.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the psychologist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "CBT typically requires fewer sessions than other forms of psychotherapy" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Patients in both groups were randomly assigned and had similar initial depression severity" },
      { letter: "C", text: "CBT teaches patients skills they can apply independently after treatment ends" },
      { letter: "D", text: "Many patients prefer non-medication treatments for depression" },
      { letter: "E", text: "The study was conducted at a leading research hospital" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Random assignment with similar initial conditions ensures a fair comparison. Without this, differences in outcomes could be due to patient selection—perhaps more motivated patients chose CBT, or those with milder depression avoided medication. Random assignment eliminates these confounds, strengthening the causal claim about CBT's effectiveness.",

    stimulus: `Environmental scientist: Ocean plastic pollution is primarily caused by inadequate waste management in coastal developing countries. Improving waste collection systems in these regions would significantly reduce the amount of plastic entering the oceans each year.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the scientist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Developed countries produce more plastic waste per capita than developing countries" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Rivers that flow through areas with poor waste management carry the majority of plastic that reaches the ocean" },
      { letter: "C", text: "International organizations have committed funding to improve waste management globally" },
      { letter: "D", text: "Plastic pollution harms marine life and ecosystems" },
      { letter: "E", text: "Recycling rates in developing countries are lower than in developed countries" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This directly supports the causal mechanism proposed. If rivers carrying waste from poorly managed areas are the main source of ocean plastic, then improving waste management in those areas would address the primary pathway. This strengthens both the diagnosis (inadequate waste management is the cause) and the proposed solution (improving collection would help).",

The canvas material and ground preparation are consistent with techniques used in 17th-century Netherlands, and the pigments include lead white produced using methods that were abandoned after 1750.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the authenticator's conclusion?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The painting has been in a private collection since the 18th century" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Modern forgers typically use materials that were available in the period they are attempting to imitate" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Other paintings attributed to this master have also been authenticated using similar methods" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The authenticator's argument rests on material analysis, particularly the pre-1750 lead white. Answer C eliminates the possibility that a forger could fake this evidence, thereby ruling out the main alternative explanation. If modern forgers cannot replicate this chemical signature, then its presence is strong evidence of authenticity.",

    stimulus: `Economist: Implementing a four-day workweek would not reduce overall productivity. When companies in pilot programs reduced working hours to 32 hours per week while maintaining salaries, productivity per hour increased substantially, keeping total output roughly constant.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the economist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Employees reported higher job satisfaction under the four-day workweek" },
      { letter: "B", text: "The companies in the pilot programs represented diverse industries including manufacturing, technology, and services" },

      { letter: "E", text: "The productivity gains were maintained for at least eighteen months after the pilot programs began" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If the pilot programs only included certain types of companies (e.g., tech firms with flexible work), the results might not generalize. Showing that diverse industries—including manufacturing, which might seem less adaptable—all maintained productivity strengthens the claim that the four-day workweek could work broadly, not just in specific contexts.",

A study following 40,000 adults for ten years found that those who drank five or more cups of green tea daily had 26 percent lower rates of heart attack and stroke compared to those who drank less than one cup daily.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?",

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The main weakness in observational studies is confounding—people who drink green tea might differ from non-drinkers in other health behaviors. If the study controlled for major cardiovascular risk factors, the remaining difference can more confidently be attributed to the green tea itself, strengthening the causal claim.",

Since wolves returned in 1995, elk populations have stabilized, willow and aspen stands have recovered along riverbanks, and beaver populations have increased.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's conclusion?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Wolves in Yellowstone primarily prey on elk, particularly weak and sick individuals" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Some elk have moved to different areas of the park to avoid wolf territories" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This provides a natural control comparison. If similar parks without wolves did not experience these improvements, it supports the claim that wolves specifically caused the changes. Without such a comparison, the improvements could be due to other factors like climate changes, park management decisions, or natural cycles that would have occurred regardless of wolf presence.",

When people have safe cycling infrastructure, many choose to bike instead of drive, reducing the number of cars on the road. This more than compensates for the small reduction in parking-related road capacity.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the urban planner's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Building new parking structures is expensive and time-consuming" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Cities that have implemented similar programs have seen cycling rates triple within two years" },

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "This directly addresses the mathematical claim that bicycle lanes 'more than compensate' for lost parking capacity. If each car-to-bike conversion saves about one parking spot worth of road space, and bicycle lanes induce many such conversions, then the net effect on road capacity would indeed be positive, supporting the anti-congestion argument.",

Withholding information, however well-intentioned, undermines patient autonomy and prevents informed decision-making about treatment options and end-of-life planning.\n\nDr. Patel: While honesty with patients is important, physicians must exercise judgment about how and when to deliver difficult news. For some patients, immediate full disclosure can cause psychological harm that interferes with treatment.
