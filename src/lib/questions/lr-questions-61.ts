    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument conflates voluntary behavior with mandated behavior. The study observed employees who chose to take breaks, but mandating breaks for all employees may not produce the same results, as the correlation might depend on the type of worker who naturally takes breaks.",

Since implementing mandatory health screenings and offering gym memberships, employee absenteeism has decreased by 20 percent.
