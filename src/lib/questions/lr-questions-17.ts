      { letter: "E", text: "overlooks the cost of implementing a mandatory break policy" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the correlation-causation fallacy. The study shows that employees who choose to take breaks are more productive, but this does not mean that forcing breaks on all employees will produce the same result. Those who voluntarily take breaks may be fundamentally different from those who do not, and the voluntary nature of the breaks may be integral to their effectiveness.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The critic makes a hasty generalization, concluding from one failure that the company will 'inevitably' fail again. This ignores that companies can learn from mistakes, improve, and succeed in future projects. One data point is insufficient to establish a pattern of inevitable failure.",

    explanation: "This is an ad hominem fallacy, specifically an attack on the arguer's potential bias. While Dr. Vance's financial interest is relevant information, it does not by itself invalidate her argument.

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that empathy can be accurately measured" },

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument confuses correlation with causation and specifically fails to consider the direction of causality. It may be that people who already have high empathy are more likely to seek out literary fiction, rather than the fiction causing the empathy. This is a classic example of reverse causation.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument states that working long hours is necessary for entrepreneurial success (all successful entrepreneurs work long hours), but then treats this necessary condition as sufficient (if someone works long hours, they must be successful). Many people work long hours without being entrepreneurs or successful; working long hours is necessary but not sufficient for entrepreneurial success.",

    stimulus: `City planner: Either we expand the highway system or traffic congestion will continue to worsen. Since expanding highways would require demolishing historic neighborhoods, we cannot expand the highway system. Therefore, traffic congestion will continue to worsen indefinitely.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the city planner's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that historic neighborhoods should be preserved at all costs" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It ignores other potential solutions to traffic congestion besides highway expansion" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It assumes that traffic congestion is primarily caused by inadequate highway capacity" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument presents a false dichotomy, suggesting only two options exist: expand highways or accept worsening congestion. In reality, other solutions exist, such as improving public transit, implementing congestion pricing, promoting remote work, or enhancing bike infrastructure. By ignoring these alternatives, the argument artificially limits the options.",

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the possibility that the defendant needed money for charitable causes" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This argument commits the fallacy of irrelevant appeal to character. A person's good reputation and charitable work, while admirable, do not logically preclude them from committing a crime. The evidence of embezzlement should be evaluated independently of the defendant's general character.",

    questionStem: "The reasoning in the professor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It relies on the professor's potentially biased memory of past student performance" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It assumes that social media use and book reading are mutually exclusive activities" },

      { letter: "E", text: "It fails to account for other differences between students today and thirty years ago" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "E",
    explanation: "The argument commits the post hoc fallacy combined with overlooking alternative explanations. Many factors besides social media have changed over thirty years: curriculum, teaching methods, student demographics, grading standards, and writing expectations. Attributing the difference solely to social media ignores these confounding variables.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument conflates popularity with effectiveness. The fact that professional athletes use a product does not prove it enhances performance. Athletes might use it due to sponsorship deals, marketing, taste preference, or tradition rather than genuine performance benefits. Widespread use is not evidence of efficacy.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "A control group receiving a placebo that showed no improvement strengthens the causal claim by ruling out placebo effects and natural improvement over time. This establishes that the mindfulness meditation specifically, rather than simply attention or expectation, caused the pain reduction.",

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Organic farms tend to be smaller than conventional farms" },

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The observation that partial pesticide reduction leads to partial recovery establishes a dose-response relationship, which is strong evidence for causation. If pollinators recover proportionally to pesticide reduction, this directly supports the claim that pesticides are the primary cause of their decline.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "If the barbarian invasions specifically targeted areas already weakened by economic problems, this supports the argument that economic factors were primary. It suggests the invasions succeeded because of pre-existing economic weakness rather than being an independent cause of the empire's fall.",
