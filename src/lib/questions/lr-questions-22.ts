    stimulus: `Mayor: Our city's crime rate has dropped by 15% since we installed surveillance cameras in the downtown area last year. Clearly, the surveillance cameras are responsible for this reduction in crime.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to consider that the crime rate might have dropped for reasons unrelated to the surveillance cameras" },
      { letter: "B", text: "assumes that all crimes are committed in the downtown area" },
      { letter: "C", text: "does not explain how surveillance cameras could possibly deter crime" },
      { letter: "D", text: "ignores the possibility that some surveillance cameras malfunctioned" },
      { letter: "E", text: "overlooks the privacy concerns raised by surveillance technology" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument commits a classic causal fallacy. Just because the crime rate dropped after cameras were installed does not mean the cameras caused the reduction. Other factors could explain the decrease, such as economic improvements, increased police presence, or seasonal variations. Choice A correctly identifies this post hoc reasoning flaw. B is incorrect because the argument doesn't require all crimes to be downtown. C is irrelevant since a mechanism isn't needed for the conclusion. D and E raise valid concerns but don't identify the logical flaw in the causal reasoning.",

    stimulus: `Nutritionist: People who take vitamin supplements daily tend to be healthier than those who do not. Therefore, taking vitamin supplements is an effective way to improve one's health.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the nutritionist's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It fails to specify what vitamins are included in the supplements" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It confuses correlation with causation by ignoring that health-conscious people may be more likely to take supplements" },
      { letter: "C", text: "It does not consider the cost of vitamin supplements" },
      { letter: "D", text: "It assumes that all vitamin supplements are equally effective" },
      { letter: "E", text: "It generalizes from a small sample to the entire population" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument confuses correlation with causation. People who take supplements may already be health-conscious and engage in other healthy behaviors (exercise, balanced diet, regular checkups), which could explain their better health. The supplements might not be the cause. B correctly identifies this flaw. A, C, and D raise tangential issues not central to the logical error. E is wrong because there's no indication the sample was small.",

    stimulus: `Professor: Student evaluations should not be used to assess teaching quality. Students who receive poor grades often give negative evaluations regardless of the actual quality of instruction. Therefore, student evaluations merely reflect students' satisfaction with their grades rather than the quality of teaching.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "draws a universal conclusion from a limited observation about some students" },
      { letter: "B", text: "fails to consider whether professors can improve based on student feedback" },
      { letter: "C", text: "assumes without justification that students are incapable of evaluating teaching" },
      { letter: "D", text: "does not acknowledge that some professors may deserve negative evaluations" },
      { letter: "E", text: "provides no evidence for the initial claim about students with poor grades" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument observes that some students (those with poor grades) give biased evaluations, but then concludes that ALL student evaluations merely reflect grade satisfaction. This is an overgeneralization that ignores students who receive good grades and still provide honest assessments, or students with poor grades who give fair evaluations. A correctly identifies this flaw. B and D are irrelevant to the logical structure. C overstates the conclusion. E notes a gap but not the main logical error.",

    stimulus: `Environmental activist: The chemical company claims its new pesticide is safe for the environment. However, this company has a financial interest in selling the pesticide. Therefore, their claims about safety cannot be trusted.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to consider independent scientific studies on the pesticide" },
      { letter: "B", text: "assumes that any party with a financial interest will necessarily be dishonest" },
      { letter: "C", text: "rejects a claim based on its source rather than evaluating the evidence for the claim" },
      { letter: "D", text: "presumes that all chemical companies make false safety claims" },
      { letter: "E", text: "overlooks the possibility that the pesticide has some environmental benefits" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "This is a genetic fallacy or ad hominem circumstantial. The argument rejects the safety claims based on who is making them (a party with financial interest) rather than examining the actual evidence for or against safety. A company's financial interest doesn't automatically make their claims false. C correctly identifies this flaw. A suggests what the argument should do but doesn't describe the flaw. B is close but less precise. D overstates the argument. E is irrelevant to the logical structure.",

    stimulus: `Literary critic: Great novels must have complex characters. This novel has remarkably complex characters. Therefore, this novel is a great novel.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to define what constitutes a complex character" },
      { letter: "B", text: "ignores other criteria that might be relevant to literary greatness" },
      { letter: "C", text: "treats a necessary condition for greatness as if it were also a sufficient condition" },
      { letter: "D", text: "assumes that all critics agree on what makes a novel great" },
      { letter: "E", text: "relies on the subjective judgment of a single critic" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument states that complex characters are necessary for greatness (great novels MUST have them). But the conclusion treats this as sufficient—having complex characters makes the novel great. This confuses necessary and sufficient conditions. A great novel needs complex characters, but complex characters alone don't guarantee greatness; other elements may also be required. C correctly identifies this classic logical flaw. B touches on this but is less precise about the logical error.",

    stimulus: `Political analyst: Senator Martinez has consistently opposed tax increases throughout her career. Recently, she voted for a bill that includes a provision raising taxes on corporations. This proves she has abandoned her principles for political convenience.`,
    questionStem: "The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to specify the size of the tax increase in the bill" },
      { letter: "B", text: "does not consider that the bill might have contained other provisions that outweighed the tax increase" },
      { letter: "C", text: "assumes that opposing tax increases is a valid political principle" },
      { letter: "D", text: "ignores the possibility that the senator changed her views based on new evidence" },
      { letter: "E", text: "relies on the assumption that all tax increases are equivalent" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that voting for a bill with a tax increase provision means abandoning opposition to tax increases. However, the senator may have voted for the bill despite the tax provision because other elements were important enough to justify the compromise. This is a common legislative reality that the argument ignores. B correctly identifies this oversight. D is plausible but less directly addresses the flaw about the bill's complexity. A and E are tangential.",

    stimulus: `Psychologist: Studies show that children who play violent video games are more aggressive than children who do not. Parents should therefore prevent their children from playing violent video games if they want to reduce their children's aggression.`,
    questionStem: "Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that video games are the only factor affecting children's aggression" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It fails to consider that aggressive children might be more drawn to violent games" },
      { letter: "C", text: "It does not specify what level of violence makes a game problematic" },
      { letter: "D", text: "It overlooks research that contradicts its conclusion" },
      { letter: "E", text: "It generalizes from controlled studies to real-world parenting situations" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that violent games cause aggression, but the correlation might run the other way: children who are already more aggressive may be attracted to violent games. This is the reverse causation possibility, a fundamental flaw in inferring causation from correlation. B correctly identifies this. A overstates what the argument assumes. C is irrelevant to the logical structure. D makes an unsupported claim. E is less central to the core logical error.",

    stimulus: `Art collector: The paintings of the Impressionists were not appreciated in their time, but are now considered masterpieces. Similarly, the abstract works being produced today, though criticized by contemporary art critics, will surely be regarded as masterpieces by future generations.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "assumes that what was true in one historical case will necessarily be true in another" },
      { letter: "B", text: "fails to define what qualifies as a masterpiece" },
      { letter: "C", text: "ignores the differences between Impressionism and abstract art" },
      { letter: "D", text: "does not consider that the Impressionists had unique talents" },
      { letter: "E", text: "overlooks the fact that some art critics appreciate abstract art" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "The argument uses a single historical precedent (Impressionism) to conclude that a similar outcome will occur for contemporary abstract art. But what happened with Impressionism doesn't guarantee the same will happen for all initially criticized art movements. Many art movements that were criticized remained unappreciated. This is a hasty generalization from one case. A correctly identifies this flaw. C notes a relevant consideration but doesn't describe the logical error as precisely.",

    id: "lr-bank22-009",
    type: "flaw",
    sectionType: "logical-reasoning",
    stimulus: `Economist: The minimum wage should not be raised because doing so would increase unemployment. When labor costs rise, businesses hire fewer workers. Since increasing the minimum wage would raise labor costs, it would necessarily lead to higher unemployment.`,
    questionStem: "The argument is flawed in that it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "ignores empirical studies on the actual effects of minimum wage increases" },
      { letter: "B", text: "assumes that the relationship between labor costs and hiring is linear and universal" },
      { letter: "C", text: "fails to consider that workers might become more productive when paid more" },
      { letter: "D", text: "treats a tendency as an absolute rule without allowing for exceptions" },
      { letter: "E", text: "does not acknowledge that some businesses can absorb higher labor costs" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument moves from a tendency (when costs rise, businesses hire fewer workers) to a necessary outcome (minimum wage increases would necessarily lead to higher unemployment). This treats a general trend as an absolute rule, ignoring that some businesses might not reduce hiring, might pass costs to consumers, or might absorb costs through reduced profits. D captures this precisely. B and E describe similar concerns but less accurately. A and C identify what the argument ignores but not the logical structure of the flaw.",

    sectionType: "logical-reasoning",
    stimulus: `Defense attorney: The prosecution argues that my client was at the crime scene because his fingerprints were found there. But my client has lived in that neighborhood for twenty years. He could have left those fingerprints at any time during those twenty years. Therefore, the fingerprint evidence does not prove my client was present during the crime.`,
    questionStem: "The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism because it",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to explain why the client's fingerprints would remain intact for twenty years" },
      { letter: "B", text: "attacks the prosecution's reasoning without establishing the client's innocence" },
      { letter: "C", text: "assumes that all fingerprint evidence is equally unreliable" },
      { letter: "D", text: "ignores the possibility that forensic analysis can determine when fingerprints were left" },
      { letter: "E", text: "contradicts itself by admitting the client was in the neighborhood" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The attorney's argument assumes that fingerprints cannot be dated, making it impossible to know when they were left. However, forensic science may be able to estimate the age of fingerprints through various techniques. By ignoring this possibility, the argument overstates the ambiguity of the evidence. D correctly identifies this oversight. A notes a valid concern but isn't the main flaw. B misunderstands defense strategy (attacking prosecution evidence is legitimate). C overgeneralizes. E mischaracterizes the argument.",

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The drug is less expensive than other heart medications currently on the market" },

    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument would be strengthened by evidence that the drug works across diverse populations, making the results more generalizable. D indicates the trial included diverse participants, suggesting the drug's effectiveness is not limited to a specific demographic. B is relevant but addresses safety rather than efficacy. A concerns cost, not effectiveness. C establishes importance but doesn't strengthen the efficacy claim. E is irrelevant to this drug's approval.",

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the urban planner's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Many cities have converted industrial sites into mixed-use developments" },

    explanation: "The argument claims parks improve quality of life through mental health benefits and community cohesion. E directly supports this by showing that neighborhoods with parks have higher satisfaction and lower stress—concrete measures of improved quality of life. B supports the claim indirectly through property values but doesn't directly address mental health or cohesion. A is irrelevant. C and D weaken the argument by noting obstacles.",

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The region has a documented history of volcanic activity" },

    explanation: "Direct physical evidence of volcanic eruption (volcanic ash above the remains) strongly supports the archaeologist's conclusion. E provides this direct evidence. C also supports the argument (intact walls suggest no battle) but is less direct than actual volcanic evidence. A establishes possibility but not actuality.

    questionStem: "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the reformer's argument?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Many colleges and employers have developed systems for interpreting narrative evaluations" },

B strengthens this by showing the two declines occurred together in the same places and times—exactly what we'd expect if the causal relationship is real. A, C, and D suggest alternative causes that might weaken the argument. E is irrelevant since the issue is egg-laying and caterpillar food, not adult nectar.",
