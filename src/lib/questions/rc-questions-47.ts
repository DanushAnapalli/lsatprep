    stimulus: `Debates surrounding cultural appropriation in artistic contexts reveal fundamental tensions between competing values of creative freedom, cultural respect, and social justice. Cultural appropriation, broadly defined as the adoption of elements from a marginalized culture by members of a dominant culture, becomes particularly contentious when such borrowing occurs without permission, understanding, or proper attribution, and when the appropriating party profits from cultural elements that the originating community cannot similarly monetize due to systemic barriers. Critics of appropriation argue that when dominant culture members extract aesthetic elements—traditional designs, musical forms, spiritual symbols—from marginalized communities while those communities face discrimination for practicing their own cultural traditions, this constitutes a form of cultural exploitation that compounds historical injustices. The harm is compounded when appropriated elements are decontextualized, stripped of their original meaning and significance, reduced to exotic decoration or fashion statement, a process that critics describe as cultural erasure masked as appreciation.

However, the concept of cultural appropriation faces significant theoretical and practical challenges. Cultures have always borrowed from one another; indeed, most cultural traditions we recognize today resulted from centuries of cross-cultural exchange, adaptation, and synthesis. Attempting to police cultural boundaries risks essentializing cultures as static, homogeneous entities "owned" by particular groups rather than recognizing them as dynamic, contested, internally diverse phenomena. Moreover, determining who has authority to grant or deny permission for cultural borrowing proves remarkably difficult: cultures lack corporate boards that can speak with singular voice, and diaspora communities often disagree among themselves about which practices constitute appropriation versus appreciation. The criteria for distinguishing problematic appropriation from legitimate cultural exchange remain unclear and contested—is the determining factor power dynamics, commercial benefit, the sacred versus secular nature of borrowed elements, the manner of representation, or some combination of these? Some theorists worry that expansive notions of cultural appropriation, by suggesting that individuals should only create art reflecting their own demographic identities, risk reinforcing the very identity-based segregation and essentialism that progressive politics ostensibly oppose.

A more nuanced approach might focus less on whether any particular instance of cross-cultural borrowing is permissible and more on the structural conditions that make some borrowing exploitative while enabling other exchanges to be mutually enriching. From this perspective, the problem is not that a white musician incorporates elements of blues or that a designer draws inspiration from Indigenous patterns, but rather that systemic inequalities mean that marginalized artists cannot access the same platforms, resources, and opportunities to profit from their own cultural traditions that dominant-culture appropriators enjoy. The issue becomes not borrowing per se but the unequal social field on which such borrowing occurs—when gatekeepers in publishing, fashion, and music industries are predominantly from dominant groups, when marginalized artists face additional barriers to institutional recognition, when audiences consume "exotic" aesthetics more readily from dominant-culture artists than from the cultures that originated them. Addressing cultural appropriation, on this view, requires not primarily regulating individual artistic choices but rather dismantling structural barriers that create unequal access to cultural and economic capital. This structural approach suggests that the solution lies not in drawing rigid boundaries around cultural practices but in creating conditions where all communities can participate as equals in ongoing cultural exchange and where economic and reputational benefits of cultural production flow more equitably to source communities.`,

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "Cultural appropriation debates reflect tensions between creative freedom and justice, with challenges to the concept leading to a structural approach focusing on unequal conditions rather than policing boundaries." },

    explanation: "Choice A captures the passage's full argument: appropriation debates and their tensions (paragraph 1), challenges to the appropriation concept (paragraph 2), and the structural approach as a resolution (paragraph 3). Choice B presents only the critics' view without the nuances and alternative approaches. Choice C overstates the theoretical challenges; the passage notes challenges without declaring the concept incoherent. Choice D focuses too narrowly on the permission problem. Choice E presents a position the passage explicitly worries against.",
