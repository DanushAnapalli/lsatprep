    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that mandating breaks will have the same positive effect as voluntary breaks. However, the autonomy to choose when to take breaks may be a crucial factor in their effectiveness. Forcing breaks could eliminate the psychological benefits that come from self-directed rest periods.",
