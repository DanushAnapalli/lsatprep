    stimulus: `The prospect of genetic enhancement—using biotechnology to augment human capacities beyond treating disease—raises profound ethical questions about the proper bounds of medical intervention. As technologies like CRISPR gene editing become more precise and accessible, the distinction between therapy (correcting dysfunction) and enhancement (improving normal function) grows increasingly salient. While few object to using genetic techniques to cure hereditary diseases like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis, proposals to enhance traits like intelligence, physical strength, or longevity generate intense controversy. Critics worry that enhancement threatens human dignity, exacerbates social inequality, and represents a dangerous form of playing God with human nature. Defenders counter that enhancement merely extends the logic of accepted medical practice and parental prerogative, offering individuals greater freedom to shape their lives and capabilities.

The therapy-enhancement distinction, though intuitively appealing, proves difficult to maintain rigorously. Medical treatment itself often enhances function beyond mere disease correction: providing growth hormone to children with normal growth patterns but predicted short stature enhances height beyond treating deficiency; cosmetic surgery enhances appearance beyond correcting deformity; vaccines enhance immune function beyond natural capacities. If these practices prove acceptable, what principled basis distinguishes permissible from impermissible enhancements? Some philosophers argue the distinction should turn on whether interventions restore species-typical functioning rather than augment beyond normal human capacities. However, determining "normal" functioning proves contentious given human variation, environmental influences on trait expression, and social construction of disability and dysfunction. Traits like nearsightedness or lactose intolerance, once normal in evolutionary terms, now qualify as treatable conditions; conversely, traits once deemed pathological may be reframed as valuable human diversity.

The distributive justice implications of enhancement technology generate particular concern. If enhancements become available only to wealthy elites, genetic technologies could entrench or exacerbate existing inequalities, creating biological hierarchies where enhanced individuals possess inherent advantages over the unenhanced. This prospect revives eugenic anxieties about stratified societies divided by genetic worth. Unlike current inequalities in wealth or education, which remain potentially remediable and do not pass automatically to offspring, genetic enhancements would create heritable advantages, hardwiring inequality into biology and potentially creating permanent genetic aristocracies. Furthermore, competitive dynamics may create enhancement arms races: if some parents enhance their children's cognitive abilities, others face pressure to enhance their own children to avoid relative disadvantage, potentially creating collective action problems where everyone pays enhancement costs merely to maintain relative position rather than achieving absolute improvement.

However, some theorists argue that enhancement could promote equality rather than undermine it. If society ensured equitable access to enhancement technologies—through public funding, universal provision, or regulatory requirements—enhancements could reduce natural lottery inequalities that distribute talents and capabilities arbitrarily. Leveling up through enhancement, in this view, proves more feasible than leveling down by restricting enhancement access, and may prove more acceptable than redistributive taxation that transfers wealth but leaves underlying capability differences intact. Moreover, enhancement opponents' embrace of natural distribution reflects a status quo bias: current genetic lottery allocation of traits is neither just nor unjust but merely random, and allowing nature to distribute capabilities does not absolve society of responsibility to address resulting inequalities through social intervention, whether redistributive or enhancement-based.

The debate extends to questions of autonomy, authenticity, and human nature. Critics contend that enhancement undermines authentic human achievement by replacing earned accomplishment with technological shortcut: the enhanced runner or scholar succeeds not through personal effort and virtue but through biological modification. This allegedly threatens conceptions of merit, desert, and moral worth tied to effort and striving. Enhancement may also constrain children's open futures: parents choosing enhancements select capabilities their children will possess, potentially limiting their freedom to choose their own paths by biologically committing them to particular talents or dispositions. Defenders respond that all child-rearing involves shaping children's capacities—through education, nutrition, enrichment—without clearly transgressing autonomy; enhancement merely offers more effective means toward accepted ends. Furthermore, the appeal to human nature or authentic achievement often masks conservative resistance to technology that could liberate humans from biological limitations, restrictions that we accept only because they seem natural or inevitable rather than because they serve genuine values worth preserving.`,

  // Passage 2: Medical Decision-Making and Informed Consent
  {
    id: "rc-34-6",
    type: "main-point",
    sectionType: "reading-comprehension",
    stimulus: `The doctrine of informed consent represents a cornerstone of contemporary medical ethics, requiring that patients receive sufficient information about proposed treatments to make voluntary, knowledgeable decisions about their own care. This principle reflects autonomy-based ethics that prioritizes individual self-determination over medical paternalism, replacing earlier models in which physicians made treatment decisions based on their professional judgment of patients' best interests with little patient input. The shift from paternalism to informed consent embodies broader cultural movements toward individual rights, consumer protection, and skepticism of professional authority, transforming the physician-patient relationship from one of fiduciary trust to one of contractual negotiation between autonomous parties.

Legal and ethical standards for informed consent require disclosure of material risks—those risks that a reasonable person would consider significant in making treatment decisions—along with expected benefits, alternative treatments, and consequences of foregoing treatment. The reasonable person standard aims to ensure patients receive information relevant to decision-making rather than merely what physicians believe patients should know. However, implementing this standard proves challenging: determining which risks qualify as "material" requires judgment calls about probability thresholds and severity levels, while comprehensive disclosure of all potential risks may overwhelm patients with technical information they lack capacity to process meaningfully. Furthermore, the reasonable person standard implicitly assumes universal informational needs, potentially failing to address particular patients' individual values, priorities, and informational requirements that may diverge from population averages.

The voluntariness requirement raises distinct complications. Informed consent presumes patients can exercise free choice unconstrained by coercion or manipulation. Yet the medical context inherently involves power imbalances, information asymmetries, and vulnerability that may undermine voluntary decision-making. Patients experiencing pain, fear, or cognitive impairment may have diminished capacity for deliberation. Time pressures, framing effects in how information is presented, and implicit bias in physicians' recommendations may subtly shape choices while leaving formal voluntariness intact. More fundamentally, serious illness constrains choice by creating circumstances where all available options may be undesirable—the cancer patient "chooses" chemotherapy not through positive endorsement but as the least-bad alternative among terrible options, raising questions about whether such constrained choices merit the label "voluntary" in any meaningful sense.

Moreover, informed consent's individualistic framework fits uneasily with family-centered medical decision-making common in many cultural traditions. The autonomous patient model presumes individuals should make decisions for themselves based on their own values and preferences. However, many patients prefer involving family members in decisions, while some cultures prioritize family or community decision-making over individual autonomy. Insisting on individual consent in such contexts may disrespect patients' relational values and cultural norms, paradoxically undermining autonomy in the name of promoting it. Conversely, deferring to family or community decision-makers may sacrifice individual patients' interests to others' preferences, particularly where patients belong to marginalized groups within families or communities whose wishes may not align with patients' own. Balancing respect for cultural diversity against protection of individual patients' interests requires sensitivity to how different patients conceive their own decision-making authority.

Finally, informed consent's focus on discrete treatment decisions may neglect systemic factors shaping available choices. Patients can only consent to options that healthcare systems make available; structural inequalities in access, insurance coverage, and resource allocation constrain choice sets before individual consent operates. A patient's "autonomous" decision to forego expensive treatment may reflect financial constraints rather than genuine preference, while consent to participate in research may be driven by lack of access to standard care rather than voluntary contribution to science. Emphasizing individual consent may obscure how structural injustices limit choices, potentially legitimating as autonomous decisions what are actually responses to unjust circumstances. Some theorists argue that genuine autonomy requires not merely respecting individual choices within existing constraints but ensuring just background conditions that make choices genuinely free—moving beyond informed consent toward structural reforms addressing the systemic determinants of health and healthcare access that fundamentally shape the options among which patients choose.`,

    stimulus: `The doctrine of informed consent represents a cornerstone of contemporary medical ethics, requiring that patients receive sufficient information about proposed treatments to make voluntary, knowledgeable decisions about their own care. This principle reflects autonomy-based ethics that prioritizes individual self-determination over medical paternalism, replacing earlier models in which physicians made treatment decisions based on their professional judgment of patients' best interests with little patient input. The shift from paternalism to informed consent embodies broader cultural movements toward individual rights, consumer protection, and skepticism of professional authority, transforming the physician-patient relationship from one of fiduciary trust to one of contractual negotiation between autonomous parties.

Legal and ethical standards for informed consent require disclosure of material risks—those risks that a reasonable person would consider significant in making treatment decisions—along with expected benefits, alternative treatments, and consequences of foregoing treatment. The reasonable person standard aims to ensure patients receive information relevant to decision-making rather than merely what physicians believe patients should know. However, implementing this standard proves challenging: determining which risks qualify as "material" requires judgment calls about probability thresholds and severity levels, while comprehensive disclosure of all potential risks may overwhelm patients with technical information they lack capacity to process meaningfully. Furthermore, the reasonable person standard implicitly assumes universal informational needs, potentially failing to address particular patients' individual values, priorities, and informational requirements that may diverge from population averages.

The voluntariness requirement raises distinct complications. Informed consent presumes patients can exercise free choice unconstrained by coercion or manipulation. Yet the medical context inherently involves power imbalances, information asymmetries, and vulnerability that may undermine voluntary decision-making. Patients experiencing pain, fear, or cognitive impairment may have diminished capacity for deliberation. Time pressures, framing effects in how information is presented, and implicit bias in physicians' recommendations may subtly shape choices while leaving formal voluntariness intact. More fundamentally, serious illness constrains choice by creating circumstances where all available options may be undesirable—the cancer patient "chooses" chemotherapy not through positive endorsement but as the least-bad alternative among terrible options, raising questions about whether such constrained choices merit the label "voluntary" in any meaningful sense.

Moreover, informed consent's individualistic framework fits uneasily with family-centered medical decision-making common in many cultural traditions. The autonomous patient model presumes individuals should make decisions for themselves based on their own values and preferences. However, many patients prefer involving family members in decisions, while some cultures prioritize family or community decision-making over individual autonomy. Insisting on individual consent in such contexts may disrespect patients' relational values and cultural norms, paradoxically undermining autonomy in the name of promoting it. Conversely, deferring to family or community decision-makers may sacrifice individual patients' interests to others' preferences, particularly where patients belong to marginalized groups within families or communities whose wishes may not align with patients' own. Balancing respect for cultural diversity against protection of individual patients' interests requires sensitivity to how different patients conceive their own decision-making authority.

Finally, informed consent's focus on discrete treatment decisions may neglect systemic factors shaping available choices. Patients can only consent to options that healthcare systems make available; structural inequalities in access, insurance coverage, and resource allocation constrain choice sets before individual consent operates. A patient's "autonomous" decision to forego expensive treatment may reflect financial constraints rather than genuine preference, while consent to participate in research may be driven by lack of access to standard care rather than voluntary contribution to science. Emphasizing individual consent may obscure how structural injustices limit choices, potentially legitimating as autonomous decisions what are actually responses to unjust circumstances. Some theorists argue that genuine autonomy requires not merely respecting individual choices within existing constraints but ensuring just background conditions that make choices genuinely free—moving beyond informed consent toward structural reforms addressing the systemic determinants of health and healthcare access that fundamentally shape the options among which patients choose.`,

  // Passage 3: End-of-Life Ethics
  {
    id: "rc-34-11",
    type: "main-point",
    sectionType: "reading-comprehension",
    stimulus: `The ethics of end-of-life medical decision-making centers on fundamental questions about the value of life, the acceptability of hastening death, and the proper role of patient autonomy in determining when and how life ends. Advances in life-sustaining technology have created situations where patients can be maintained biologically alive despite permanent unconsciousness, minimal consciousness, or dependence on mechanical support that previous generations would have considered inconsistent with meaningful survival. These technological capabilities have forced explicit consideration of questions that medical limitations once resolved implicitly: when does continued biological existence serve patient interests, and who should decide when maintaining life no longer benefits the patient?

The distinction between withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and active euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide proves central to legal and ethical analysis. The former—allowing patients to refuse treatment including mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, or dialysis—is widely accepted legally and ethically as respecting patient autonomy and acknowledging limits to beneficial medical intervention. The latter—actively administering lethal medication at patient request or providing patients with means to end their own lives—remains illegal in most jurisdictions and ethically controversial, prohibited by major medical associations' ethics codes despite legalization in several states and countries. Defenders of this distinction argue that letting die differs morally from killing: physicians who withdraw treatment merely allow disease to take its natural course, while those who administer lethal medication causally bring about death through their actions. Furthermore, professional role considerations may permit physicians to cease ineffective treatment while prohibiting them from intentionally causing patient death, which contradicts medicine's healing mission.

Critics challenge this distinction as morally arbitrary. They contend that intention matters more than mechanism: both withdrawal and active assistance aim to end life deemed no longer worth living, with physicians foreseeing death as the inevitable result of their actions in both cases. The causal distinction proves unstable—withdrawing ventilation from a patient who cannot breathe independently kills the patient as surely as lethal injection, with death resulting from the physician's action rather than disease alone. Moreover, allowing only withdrawal may produce worse outcomes: patients who could die quickly and peacefully through medication may instead endure prolonged, uncomfortable deaths through dehydration or respiratory failure following treatment withdrawal. If patient autonomy and relief of suffering justify allowing death through withdrawal, these same values support more direct means of achieving the same end.

The role of patient autonomy in end-of-life decisions raises additional complexities. Autonomy-based arguments support patient rights to refuse unwanted treatment, but extending autonomy to active death assistance requires addressing whether autonomy includes rights to enlist others in ending one's life. Furthermore, concerns about vulnerable populations—elderly individuals feeling burdensome to families, disabled persons facing social devaluation, poor patients lacking access to quality palliative care—suggest that permitting assisted death may enable socially-driven decisions rather than purely autonomous choices. The requirement of voluntariness may prove inadequate protection when subtle pressures, resource constraints, or biased counseling influence ostensibly free choices. Conversely, prohibiting assisted death arguably disrespects patient autonomy by denying competent adults' decisions about their own deaths, privileging other-regarding concerns about potential abuse over self-regarding choices about whether continued life serves one's interests.

Finally, the adequacy of palliative care and the goals of medicine shape debates about hastened death. If pain and suffering could be adequately controlled through improved palliative care, requests for hastened death might diminish or disappear, suggesting that improving care rather than enabling death better serves patient interests. The hospice movement's success in managing end-of-life symptoms while maintaining quality of life demonstrates palliative care's potential, raising questions about whether assisted death requests reflect failure to provide adequate palliative options rather than autonomous choices. However, some patients request hastened death not to escape physical pain but to avoid progressive deterioration, loss of dignity, or dependence that palliative care cannot address. For these patients, the availability of assistance may provide reassurance and sense of control that paradoxically reduces urgency to use it, while prohibition creates existential distress from knowing that intolerable future states cannot be escaped. The debate ultimately implicates fundamental disagreements about medicine's proper goals: whether physicians should seek only to preserve biological life and relieve suffering within life, or whether they may appropriately assist patients in achieving good deaths when continued life no longer serves patients' values and ends.`,

The requirement of voluntariness may prove inadequate protection when subtle pressures, resource constraints, or biased counseling influence ostensibly free choices. Conversely, prohibiting assisted death arguably disrespects patient autonomy by denying competent adults' decisions about their own deaths, privileging other-regarding concerns about potential abuse over self-regarding choices about whether continued life serves one's interests.

Finally, the adequacy of palliative care and the goals of medicine shape debates about hastened death. If pain and suffering could be adequately controlled through improved palliative care, requests for hastened death might diminish or disappear, suggesting that improving care rather than enabling death better serves patient interests. The hospice movement's success in managing end-of-life symptoms while maintaining quality of life demonstrates palliative care's potential, raising questions about whether assisted death requests reflect failure to provide adequate palliative options rather than autonomous choices. However, some patients request hastened death not to escape physical pain but to avoid progressive deterioration, loss of dignity, or dependence that palliative care cannot address. For these patients, the availability of assistance may provide reassurance and sense of control that paradoxically reduces urgency to use it, while prohibition creates existential distress from knowing that intolerable future states cannot be escaped. The debate ultimately implicates fundamental disagreements about medicine's proper goals: whether physicians should seek only to preserve biological life and relieve suffering within life, or whether they may appropriately assist patients in achieving good deaths when continued life no longer serves patients' values and ends.`,

    stimulus: `The ethics of end-of-life medical decision-making centers on fundamental questions about the value of life, the acceptability of hastening death, and the proper role of patient autonomy in determining when and how life ends. Advances in life-sustaining technology have created situations where patients can be maintained biologically alive despite permanent unconsciousness, minimal consciousness, or dependence on mechanical support that previous generations would have considered inconsistent with meaningful survival. These technological capabilities have forced explicit consideration of questions that medical limitations once resolved implicitly: when does continued biological existence serve patient interests, and who should decide when maintaining life no longer benefits the patient?

The distinction between withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and active euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide proves central to legal and ethical analysis. The former—allowing patients to refuse treatment including mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, or dialysis—is widely accepted legally and ethically as respecting patient autonomy and acknowledging limits to beneficial medical intervention. The latter—actively administering lethal medication at patient request or providing patients with means to end their own lives—remains illegal in most jurisdictions and ethically controversial, prohibited by major medical associations' ethics codes despite legalization in several states and countries. Defenders of this distinction argue that letting die differs morally from killing: physicians who withdraw treatment merely allow disease to take its natural course, while those who administer lethal medication causally bring about death through their actions. Furthermore, professional role considerations may permit physicians to cease ineffective treatment while prohibiting them from intentionally causing patient death, which contradicts medicine's healing mission.

Critics challenge this distinction as morally arbitrary. They contend that intention matters more than mechanism: both withdrawal and active assistance aim to end life deemed no longer worth living, with physicians foreseeing death as the inevitable result of their actions in both cases. The causal distinction proves unstable—withdrawing ventilation from a patient who cannot breathe independently kills the patient as surely as lethal injection, with death resulting from the physician's action rather than disease alone. Moreover, allowing only withdrawal may produce worse outcomes: patients who could die quickly and peacefully through medication may instead endure prolonged, uncomfortable deaths through dehydration or respiratory failure following treatment withdrawal. If patient autonomy and relief of suffering justify allowing death through withdrawal, these same values support more direct means of achieving the same end.

The role of patient autonomy in end-of-life decisions raises additional complexities. Autonomy-based arguments support patient rights to refuse unwanted treatment, but extending autonomy to active death assistance requires addressing whether autonomy includes rights to enlist others in ending one's life. Furthermore, concerns about vulnerable populations—elderly individuals feeling burdensome to families, disabled persons facing social devaluation, poor patients lacking access to quality palliative care—suggest that permitting assisted death may enable socially-driven decisions rather than purely autonomous choices.

  // Passage 4: Research Ethics and Human Subjects Protection
  {

    type: "main-point",
    sectionType: "reading-comprehension",
    stimulus: `Research ethics governing human subjects research emerged largely in response to historical abuses, most notably the Nazi medical experiments and the Tuskegee syphilis study, which revealed how scientific research could instrumentalize human beings, sacrificing individual welfare to knowledge advancement. The Nuremberg Code, Declaration of Helsinki, and Belmont Report established core principles—respect for persons, beneficence, and justice—that shape contemporary research regulation through institutional review boards (IRBs) charged with protecting research participants. These frameworks require voluntary informed consent, favorable risk-benefit ratios, and fair subject selection, attempting to ensure that research advancement does not come at the cost of exploiting or harming vulnerable individuals.

The informed consent requirement in research contexts raises distinctive challenges beyond clinical care. Research participation, unlike treatment, aims primarily to generate generalizable knowledge rather than benefit particular participants, creating tension between individual and collective interests. Therapeutic misconception—participants' mistaken belief that research interventions are designed to benefit them personally rather than test hypotheses—may undermine consent's validity when participants conflate research and treatment. Furthermore, randomization to control groups, placebo administration, and blinding procedures standard in rigorous research may conflict with individualized care's patient-centered orientation. Disclosing these features requires helping participants understand research's primary purpose while acknowledging that some may derive incidental benefit.

Justice in subject selection proves particularly complex in research contexts. Historical research abuses often exploited disadvantaged populations—prisoners, racial minorities, institutionalized individuals—whose vulnerability made them convenient subjects while benefits of resulting knowledge flowed primarily to more privileged groups. Contemporary research ethics emphasizes protecting vulnerable populations from exploitation through heightened scrutiny of research involving such groups. However, this protective approach creates paradoxical injustice: excluding vulnerable populations from research means that treatments and interventions are tested primarily on non-vulnerable groups, potentially producing knowledge inapplicable to or less effective for excluded populations. Women's historical exclusion from clinical trials, justified as protecting them and potential fetuses, resulted in medications tested predominantly on men being prescribed to women despite potential sex-based efficacy or side-effect differences.

The globalization of research raises additional justice concerns. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly conduct clinical trials in low-and middle-income countries, where large treatment-naive populations, lower costs, and less stringent regulation enable faster, cheaper research. While such research may benefit host countries through local capacity building and access to investigational treatments, concerns about exploitation arise when research addresses diseases of wealthy countries, uses local populations to test products marketed elsewhere, or concludes without ensuring continued access to beneficial interventions for research participants or host communities. The standard of care debates illustrate these tensions: should control groups in international trials receive the best proven intervention available globally, or merely the standard care available locally? The former protects research participants but may render trials impractical in resource-poor settings; the latter enables research but potentially exploits populations by providing lower-quality care than researchers would accept for their own compatriots.

Finally, the risk-benefit assessment required for IRB approval involves incommensurable values. How should risks of research harm be weighed against potential benefits to knowledge and future patients? IRBs must determine whether risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, but this assessment requires comparing individual research participants' risk-bearing against diffuse societal benefits from knowledge advancement. The calculation proves especially fraught for research offering participants no realistic prospect of direct benefit while imposing non-trivial risks. Can such research ever be ethical, or does it inherently instrumentalize participants by using them as means to others' ends? Some argue that voluntary consent suffices: if competent adults freely agree to bear risks for knowledge advancement or altruistic purposes, such choices merit respect regardless of benefit distribution. Others contend that societal vulnerability—research participants' often disadvantaged circumstances that make research participation attractive or necessary—undermines voluntariness, requiring substantive benefit-sharing rather than merely procedural consent to legitimate research that exposes participants to risk for others' benefit.`,
