    stimulus: `Professor Martinez argues that because most successful lawyers attended prestigious law schools, attending a prestigious law school is necessary for becoming a successful lawyer. However, she fails to consider that many factors beyond law school prestige contribute to legal success, including personal connections, work ethic, and practice area selection.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "The argument concludes that attending a prestigious law school is necessary for success based on evidence that most successful lawyers attended such schools. This confuses what might be sufficient (or merely correlated) with what is necessary. Even if attending a prestigious school helps, it doesn't mean it's required for success.",

    explanation: "The argument assumes that employees will actually participate in exercise. If most employees who sign up actually use the benefits regularly, this strengthens the connection between offering the program and achieving the health benefits that reduce costs.

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If retail sales across the entire region increased by 30% while downtown only increased 25%, this suggests the downtown area actually underperformed relative to the broader trend. The increase might have occurred regardless of the revitalization project, or the project might have actually hindered growth compared to what would have happened otherwise.",

This shows that music education improves cognitive abilities that are tested on standardized exams. Schools should therefore require music education for all students to improve test scores.`,
