// PASSAGE 1: The Search for Exoplanets and Habitability
const passage1 = `The discovery of thousands of exoplanets—planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system—has transformed our understanding of planetary systems and reinvigorated the ancient question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe. Early exoplanet detection methods, primarily the radial velocity technique developed in the 1990s, revealed an unexpected diversity of planetary systems. Astronomers discovered massive gas giants orbiting extremely close to their host stars, a configuration radically different from our solar system's architecture and one that challenged existing theories of planet formation.

The subsequent development of the transit method, which detects planets by measuring the slight dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it, dramatically accelerated the rate of discovery. NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, launched in 2009 specifically to search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone—the region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface—detected thousands of candidate planets before its mission ended. These discoveries revealed that planets are ubiquitous in our galaxy, with many stars hosting multiple planets, and that Earth-sized rocky planets are common.

However, the question of habitability is far more complex than simply locating planets in the habitable zone. A planet's actual surface conditions depend on numerous factors beyond its distance from its star, including atmospheric composition, magnetic field strength, tidal forces, and the planet's geological activity. Venus, despite residing within our own solar system's habitable zone for part of its history, experienced a runaway greenhouse effect that transformed it into a hostile world with surface temperatures exceeding 450 degrees Celsius. This cautionary example demonstrates that the habitable zone concept, while useful as an initial filter, provides an incomplete picture of a planet's potential to support life.

Recent research has expanded the traditional concept of habitability in significant ways. Some astrobiologists now argue that the focus on Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars may be too narrow. Red dwarf stars, which are smaller, cooler, and far more numerous than Sun-like stars, dominate the galaxy. Although planets in the habitable zones of red dwarfs orbit very close to their stars and may be tidally locked (with one side perpetually facing the star), recent climate models suggest that atmospheric circulation could distribute heat around such planets, potentially maintaining habitable conditions. If red dwarf planets can indeed support life, the number of potentially habitable worlds in the galaxy increases dramatically.

Furthermore, discoveries within our own solar system have revealed that habitability may not require a planet at all. Several moons of Jupiter and Saturn—particularly Europa and Enceladus—harbor subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts, maintained by tidal heating from their giant planets' gravitational forces. These oceans may have existed for billions of years, potentially providing stable environments for life to emerge. This realization has led some scientists to suggest that ocean worlds, which could exist far beyond the traditional habitable zone of their stars, may be more common sites for life than terrestrial planets with surface water. Such a paradigm shift would fundamentally alter how we search for life in the universe and what signatures we look for.`;

// PASSAGE 2: Dark Matter and Galaxy Formation
const passage2 = `The standard model of cosmology holds that ordinary matter—the atoms that make up stars, planets, and everything we can directly observe—constitutes only about 5 percent of the universe's total mass-energy content. Approximately 27 percent consists of dark matter, a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to all telescopes. The remaining 68 percent is dark energy, an even more enigmatic component responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. Despite its elusiveness, dark matter plays a crucial role in our current understanding of how galaxies form and evolve.

Evidence for dark matter comes from multiple independent observations. In the 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin discovered that stars in the outer regions of spiral galaxies orbit at surprisingly high velocities—so high that the visible matter alone could not provide sufficient gravitational force to hold them in orbit. The stars should fly off into space, yet galaxies remain intact. This discrepancy can be explained if galaxies are embedded in massive halos of dark matter whose gravity provides the additional force needed to keep stars in their orbits. Subsequent observations, including gravitational lensing effects and the cosmic microwave background radiation, have provided additional evidence for dark matter's existence.

The prevailing theory posits that dark matter consists of as-yet-undetected subatomic particles that interact only through gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force. Numerous experiments have attempted to directly detect these particles, using detectors placed deep underground to shield them from cosmic rays and other background radiation. Despite decades of searching with increasingly sensitive instruments, no experiment has definitively detected a dark matter particle. This failure has prompted some physicists to question whether dark matter exists at all, proposing instead that our understanding of gravity at galactic scales is incomplete.

The most prominent alternative to dark matter is Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which suggests that Newton's laws of motion and gravity break down at the extremely low accelerations characteristic of the outer regions of galaxies. MOND successfully reproduces the observed rotation curves of many galaxies without invoking dark matter. However, MOND faces significant challenges. It has difficulty explaining observations at larger scales, such as the distribution of matter in galaxy clusters and the pattern of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. Most cosmologists remain unconvinced that MOND can account for all the observations that dark matter theory explains, though they acknowledge that the continued failure to detect dark matter particles raises legitimate questions.

A middle position has emerged among some theorists who suggest that both dark matter and modifications to gravity may be necessary to fully explain cosmological observations. They propose that dark matter exists but has different properties than the standard weakly interacting massive particles most experiments have searched for, and that gravity may also require modification at certain scales. This hybrid approach, while more complex, might resolve some of the tensions between observations and theory. However, without direct detection of dark matter or clear evidence for gravitational modification, the debate remains unresolved, representing one of the most significant open questions in physics.`;

// PASSAGE 3: The Hubble Tension and Cosmic Expansion
const passage3 = `The universe is expanding, carrying galaxies away from each other as space itself stretches. The rate of this expansion, known as the Hubble constant, is one of the most fundamental parameters in cosmology, as it determines the universe's age, size, and ultimate fate. However, recent precise measurements have revealed a troubling inconsistency: different methods for measuring the Hubble constant yield significantly different values, a discrepancy cosmologists call the "Hubble tension." This tension has grown into a crisis that may indicate unknown physics beyond our current cosmological model.

One method for measuring the Hubble constant relies on observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)—the faint afterglow of the Big Bang that fills all of space. The European Space Agency's Planck satellite mapped tiny temperature fluctuations in the CMB with unprecedented precision, allowing cosmologists to determine the density of matter, dark energy, and other parameters in the early universe. Using the standard cosmological model (called Lambda-CDM) to extrapolate from these early-universe measurements to the present day, researchers calculate a Hubble constant value of approximately 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec.

An independent method uses the cosmic distance ladder, a technique that builds up measurements from nearby to distant objects. Astronomers first measure distances to nearby stars using parallax, then use these stars to calibrate the brightness of Cepheid variable stars—stars whose intrinsic brightness can be determined from their pulsation periods. Cepheids in turn calibrate even brighter objects like Type Ia supernovae, which can be observed in distant galaxies. By comparing the observed brightness of these "standard candles" to their known intrinsic brightness, astronomers can determine their distances and measure how fast they are receding. This method yields a Hubble constant of approximately 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec—significantly higher than the CMB-based value.

The difference may seem small, but it is statistically significant and has persisted despite refinements to both measurement techniques. If confirmed, this discrepancy implies that something is wrong with our understanding of the universe. One possibility is unrecognized systematic errors in one or both measurement methods. The distance ladder depends on multiple calibration steps, each with potential uncertainties, while the CMB method relies on the Lambda-CDM model being correct—an assumption that may not hold if unknown physics operated in the early universe.

Alternatively, the Hubble tension might indicate genuinely new physics. Some cosmologists propose modifications to dark energy that would make it evolve over time rather than remaining constant, affecting the expansion rate differently in the early and late universe. Others suggest the existence of additional relativistic particles in the early universe, or even that we live in a local region of space with different properties than the broader universe. Each proposal has testable implications, and future observations from projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory may help resolve the tension by providing independent measurements of cosmic distances and expansion rates. Whether the solution involves refining current techniques or discovering new physics, the Hubble tension represents a crucial puzzle that could reshape our understanding of cosmic evolution.`;

// PASSAGE 4: Commercial Space Exploration and Space Law
const passage4 = `The emergence of commercial space companies has dramatically altered the landscape of space exploration, raising novel legal questions that existing international space law was not designed to address. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which remains the foundation of space law, established principles appropriate for an era when only nation-states could access space. It declares that outer space is the "province of all mankind," that celestial bodies cannot be subject to national appropriation, and that nations bear responsibility for national activities in space, including those conducted by private entities. However, the treaty's framers did not anticipate a future where private companies would mine asteroids, manufacture goods in orbit, or establish commercial settlements on the Moon or Mars.

The question of property rights in space represents the most contentious legal issue. The Outer Space Treaty's prohibition on national appropriation has been interpreted by some legal scholars to also prohibit private property claims, since private actors operate under the authority of their national governments. Under this interpretation, a company that invests billions in extracting resources from an asteroid would have no legal claim to those resources, making such ventures economically impractical. Other scholars argue that the treaty only prohibits territorial sovereignty claims, not property rights in extracted resources, drawing an analogy to the law of the sea, where nations cannot claim sovereignty over ocean areas but can own fish they catch in international waters.

The United States attempted to resolve this ambiguity through the 2015 Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which explicitly grants U.S. citizens the right to own resources extracted from asteroids and other celestial bodies. Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates have enacted similar legislation. However, the legal status of these national laws remains uncertain, as some nations argue they violate the Outer Space Treaty and are therefore invalid under international law. Without international consensus, companies face legal uncertainty that could inhibit investment in space resource extraction—a particularly serious concern for ventures requiring decades and billions of dollars to reach profitability.

Beyond property rights, commercial space activities raise questions about liability, safety regulation, and environmental protection. The Outer Space Treaty makes nations liable for damage caused by objects launched from their territory, but applying this framework to commercial activities involving thousands of satellites or extensive mining operations is challenging. Who bears liability if a defunct commercial satellite causes a collision cascade that destroys other satellites? How should nations regulate private activities to ensure they meet treaty obligations? Current regulatory frameworks, developed when government agencies controlled space access, may be inadequate for managing a commercial space industry characterized by rapid innovation and lower barriers to entry.

Some legal experts advocate for a new comprehensive treaty that would update space law for the commercial era, establishing clear rules for property rights, resource extraction, liability, and environmental protection. Others argue that the existing treaty framework is sufficiently flexible and that specific issues should be addressed through multilateral agreements focused on particular activities, similar to how international aviation developed through sector-specific conventions. A third perspective suggests that customary international law will develop through state practice as nations and companies engage in commercial space activities, with disputes resolved through negotiation and arbitration rather than formal treaties. The approach ultimately adopted will shape not only the commercial prospects of space ventures but also whether space development benefits all humanity or primarily serves the interests of spacefaring nations and wealthy corporations.`;
