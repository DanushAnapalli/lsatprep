    stimulus: `A recent study found that employees who take regular breaks during work hours are more productive than those who work continuously. Therefore, companies should require all employees to take mandatory breaks every hour, as this will inevitably lead to increased productivity across the organization.`,

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "fails to consider that some employees may already take regular breaks voluntarily" },

      { letter: "E", text: "ignores the potential costs of implementing mandatory break policies" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes that mandatory breaks will have the same positive effect as voluntary breaks. However, the original study measured employees who chose to take breaks, and forcing breaks on all employees may not produce the same results. The behavior's effectiveness when voluntary may not transfer to when it is compelled.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument commits the flaw of overgeneralization. From one instance of unethical behavior (lying about qualifications), it concludes that Marcus has no ethical principles at all and will always behave unethically. A single action does not justify such a sweeping conclusion about a person's entire character.",

    stimulus: `Researchers hypothesize that the decline in monarch butterfly populations is primarily caused by the reduced availability of milkweed plants, which are the only food source for monarch caterpillars. Over the past two decades, herbicide-resistant crops have led to more intensive weed control in agricultural areas, significantly reducing milkweed populations in the Midwest.`,

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "This choice directly strengthens the causal link between milkweed availability and monarch survival. If monarchs in milkweed-rich areas have higher survival rates, this supports the hypothesis that milkweed reduction is causing population decline. Option D only shows correlation in timing, while A demonstrates the actual effect of milkweed on monarch populations.",

The company concludes that doctors should preferentially prescribe this medication to patients requiring long-term pain management.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "If gastrointestinal problems are the primary reason patients stop taking long-term pain medication, then a drug with fewer such side effects would be particularly valuable for long-term use. This strengthens the conclusion that doctors should prefer this medication for patients needing long-term pain management.",

They point to data showing that the number of accidents at intersections with cameras has decreased by 30 percent since the cameras were installed. The officials conclude that expanding the speed camera program to all major intersections would significantly reduce the city's overall accident rate.`,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This introduces the concept of regression to the mean. If cameras were placed at intersections with unusually high accident rates, those rates would likely decrease over time regardless of the cameras, simply because extreme values tend to move toward the average. This alternative explanation weakens the claim that cameras caused the reduction.",

They conclude that expanding organic farming would require converting more natural habitats to farmland, which would be environmentally destructive.`,

However, this debate overlooks a crucial point: regardless of their ultimate metaphysical status, moral beliefs function in society as if they were objective truths. People argue about ethics, condemn certain actions as wrong, and feel genuine moral outrage. Therefore, for practical purposes, we should treat moral discourse as meaningful and continue to engage in moral reasoning as we always have.`,

This means something other than subsidies must be driving the growth - likely the cost decreases and efficiency improvements mentioned. Therefore, factors other than government subsidies have contributed to the growth.",
