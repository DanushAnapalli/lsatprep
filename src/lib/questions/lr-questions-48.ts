    stimulus: `A recent study found that employees who take regular breaks during the workday are more productive than those who work continuously. Therefore, companies should mandate that all employees take a fifteen-minute break every two hours to maximize productivity.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument moves from a study about employees who voluntarily take breaks to a recommendation for mandatory breaks. The flaw is that mandatory breaks might not have the same positive effects as voluntary ones—employees who choose to take breaks may do so at optimal times for their work patterns, whereas mandatory breaks could interrupt productive work periods.",

    stimulus: `Archaeologists have discovered that ancient Roman concrete structures have lasted for over two thousand years, while modern concrete typically begins to deteriorate after fifty years. The key difference is that Roman concrete contained volcanic ash, which created a chemical reaction with seawater that actually strengthened the material over time. Modern engineers should therefore incorporate volcanic ash into concrete mixtures for coastal structures.`,

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument recommends using volcanic ash in coastal structures based on the observed durability of Roman concrete. Choice B strengthens this by confirming that the beneficial chemical reaction is ongoing and unlimited, meaning the concrete will continue to strengthen rather than eventually reaching a point of diminishing returns.",

They point to data showing that in the first year after cameras were installed on Highway 7, accidents decreased by 30 percent. This proves that speed cameras are effective at improving road safety.`,

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument attributes the 30% decrease in accidents to speed cameras. Choice C severely weakens this by showing that roads without cameras experienced a nearly identical decrease (28%), suggesting that external factors like weather—not the cameras—were responsible for the improvement.",

However, the fact that different cultures have different moral practices does not prove that there are no objective moral standards—after all, different cultures also have different beliefs about scientific facts, yet this does not mean there are no objective scientific truths.

When automobiles first appeared, people warned they would cause countless deaths and destroy communities. When television emerged, critics predicted it would end social interaction. Today, artificial intelligence faces similar criticism. Since previous fears about technology proved unfounded, concerns about AI are similarly baseless.`,
