    stimulus: `The question of whether artificial intelligence systems can possess consciousness has moved from science fiction speculation to serious philosophical inquiry. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated—generating creative text, engaging in seemingly meaningful conversations, and solving complex problems—the question gains urgency. What would it mean for a machine to be conscious, and how would we know?

The "hard problem" of consciousness, as philosopher David Chalmers termed it, involves explaining why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all. We understand much about how the brain processes information, but the leap from neural activity to the felt quality of experience—what it is like to see red or feel pain—remains mysterious. This mystery applies equally to silicon-based systems: even if we perfectly understood an AI system's computational processes, would this explain what it might experience?

Some philosophers argue that consciousness requires biological substrates—that there is something about the particular chemistry and structure of neurons that gives rise to experience in ways that silicon circuits cannot replicate. Others contend that consciousness is "substrate-independent"—that it depends only on the right kind of information processing, regardless of what physical system implements it. If the latter view is correct, sufficiently advanced AI could, in principle, be conscious.

The functionalist view holds that mental states are defined by their functional roles—their relationships to sensory inputs, behavioral outputs, and other mental states. On this view, if an AI system had internal states that played the same functional roles as human conscious states, it would be conscious by definition. Critics argue that functional equivalence might exist without any accompanying experience—what philosophers call a "zombie" scenario—where all the functions are present but "the lights are off inside."

The implications extend beyond philosophy. If AI systems can be conscious, they might have moral status—interests that deserve consideration, perhaps even rights. We would need to consider not just what AI can do for us, but what we might owe to AI. Conversely, if consciousness requires biological substrates, then AI systems, however sophisticated, would remain tools rather than moral patients. The stakes of getting this question right are substantial.`,

  // Passage 2: Environmental Economics - Carbon Markets
  {
    id: "rc-3-006",
    sectionType: "reading-comprehension",
    stimulus: `Carbon markets have emerged as a prominent tool in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The basic principle is elegant: by putting a price on carbon emissions, markets incentivize businesses to reduce pollution and reward those who do so efficiently. Whether through cap-and-trade systems that set emission limits and allow trading of allowances, or through carbon offset programs that fund emission-reducing projects, these market mechanisms promise to harness economic forces for environmental benefit.

The European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), launched in 2005, represents the world's largest carbon market. Under this system, power plants and industrial facilities receive or purchase allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit. Companies that reduce emissions below their allowance can sell surplus credits to those exceeding their limits. The price signal, advocates argue, drives investment toward cleaner technologies by making pollution costly.

Critics raise several concerns. First, carbon prices have proven volatile and often too low to drive significant behavioral change. When the EU ETS price collapsed in its early years, it provided little incentive for emission reduction. Second, offset programs have faced credibility challenges: if a forest conservation project would have happened anyway, selling credits for it generates no additional environmental benefit—a problem called "additionality." Third, some argue that carbon markets allow wealthy entities to continue polluting by purchasing credits rather than making operational changes.

Defenders respond that these are implementation challenges rather than fundamental flaws. Carbon price floors can prevent collapse, rigorous certification can address additionality concerns, and caps can be tightened over time. The alternative—direct regulation or carbon taxes—faces political obstacles that market mechanisms can sometimes avoid. Even imperfect carbon pricing, proponents argue, is better than no pricing at all.

The debate ultimately concerns how much faith to place in market mechanisms for achieving environmental goals. Markets excel at finding efficient solutions to defined problems, but environmental protection may require values and considerations that markets do not naturally incorporate. Whether carbon markets represent a pragmatic tool or a dangerous distraction from more effective approaches remains contested.`,

  // Passage 3: Legal Theory - Originalism in Constitutional Interpretation
  {
    id: "rc-3-011",
    sectionType: "reading-comprehension",
    stimulus: `Originalism holds that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning—either the intent of the framers or the public understanding at the time of ratification. Its proponents argue that this approach constrains judicial discretion and preserves democratic legitimacy. If judges can interpret the Constitution according to their own views of good policy, they become unelected legislators. Originalism anchors interpretation in historical fact, not judicial preference.

The theory has evolved considerably since its emergence in the 1970s and 1980s. Early originalists focused on framers' intent, but this approach faced the problem of determining whose intent among many framers, and whether private intentions should govern public texts. "Original public meaning" originalism emerged as the dominant variant, focusing on how a reasonable member of the public at the time of ratification would have understood the constitutional text.

Critics raise several objections. First, the historical record is often ambiguous or silent on questions that arise centuries later—the Constitution says nothing explicit about wiretapping or abortion. Second, many constitutional provisions were deliberately written in broad terms ("equal protection," "due process") that seem to invite application to new circumstances. Third, critics argue that originalism itself involves interpretive choices: selecting which historical evidence counts, at what level of generality to read provisions, and how to apply historical meanings to modern contexts.

The debate between originalists and living constitutionalists—who believe the Constitution's meaning can evolve with changing social values—reflects deeper disagreements about the nature of interpretation, the role of history in law, and the proper relationship between courts and democratic processes. Both sides claim fidelity to the Constitution while differing profoundly on what such fidelity requires.

Perhaps most challenging for originalism is the question of whose "original understanding" counts. The Constitution was ratified by a relatively narrow segment of the population—white male property owners. Women, enslaved persons, and others excluded from the political process presumably had different understandings than those who controlled ratification. Selecting the ratifiers' understanding as authoritative itself involves a value judgment that originalism claims to avoid.`,

    stimulus: `Originalism holds that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning—either the intent of the framers or the public understanding at the time of ratification. Its proponents argue that this approach constrains judicial discretion and preserves democratic legitimacy. If judges can interpret the Constitution according to their own views of good policy, they become unelected legislators. Originalism anchors interpretation in historical fact, not judicial preference.

The theory has evolved considerably since its emergence in the 1970s and 1980s. Early originalists focused on framers' intent, but this approach faced the problem of determining whose intent among many framers, and whether private intentions should govern public texts. "Original public meaning" originalism emerged as the dominant variant, focusing on how a reasonable member of the public at the time of ratification would have understood the constitutional text.

Critics raise several objections. First, the historical record is often ambiguous or silent on questions that arise centuries later—the Constitution says nothing explicit about wiretapping or abortion. Second, many constitutional provisions were deliberately written in broad terms ("equal protection," "due process") that seem to invite application to new circumstances. Third, critics argue that originalism itself involves interpretive choices: selecting which historical evidence counts, at what level of generality to read provisions, and how to apply historical meanings to modern contexts.

The debate between originalists and living constitutionalists—who believe the Constitution's meaning can evolve with changing social values—reflects deeper disagreements about the nature of interpretation, the role of history in law, and the proper relationship between courts and democratic processes. Both sides claim fidelity to the Constitution while differing profoundly on what such fidelity requires.

Perhaps most challenging for originalism is the question of whose "original understanding" counts. The Constitution was ratified by a relatively narrow segment of the population—white male property owners. Women, enslaved persons, and others excluded from the political process presumably had different understandings than those who controlled ratification. Selecting the ratifiers' understanding as authoritative itself involves a value judgment that originalism claims to avoid.`,

  // Passage 4: Sociology - Social Media and Political Polarization
  {

    stimulus: `The relationship between social media and political polarization has become a subject of intense debate among researchers. The conventional narrative holds that social media creates "echo chambers" and "filter bubbles" where users encounter only information that confirms their existing beliefs, leading to increasingly extreme views. Algorithmic curation, which shows users content similar to what they have previously engaged with, allegedly accelerates this process.

However, recent research has complicated this picture. Studies comparing social media users to non-users find that polarization has increased most dramatically among older Americans who use social media least. Moreover, research tracking online behavior shows that social media users actually encounter more diverse viewpoints than those who rely solely on traditional media. The echo chamber effect may be overstated.

Alternative explanations for polarization focus on factors beyond social media. Elite polarization—increased ideological distance between party leaders—has grown steadily since the 1970s, well before social media existed. Geographic sorting, with liberals and conservatives increasingly living in different places, reduces cross-partisan contact. Changes in media economics have incentivized partisan content across all platforms, not just social media.

Yet social media may contribute to polarization through mechanisms other than echo chambers. Exposure to opposing views on social media often occurs in hostile, unproductive contexts that increase rather than decrease partisan antipathy. The platforms' design rewards emotionally engaging content, which tends to be more extreme. And even if individual users encounter diverse content, the aggregation of many interactions may still produce a more polarized information environment overall.

The debate reflects broader uncertainty about technology's social effects. Social media platforms are vast, varied, and rapidly changing, making definitive conclusions difficult. Different platforms, user demographics, and national contexts may produce different dynamics. The most honest assessment may be that social media is neither the primary cause of polarization nor entirely innocent—a contributing factor whose importance varies by context and mechanism.`,
