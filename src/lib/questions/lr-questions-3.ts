    stimulus: `Historian: Ancient civilization X must have had contact with ancient civilization Y because both civilizations built pyramid structures. The similarity cannot be a coincidence.`,
    questionStem: "The historian's reasoning is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?",
    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "It assumes that pyramids could only be invented once" },
      { letter: "B", text: "It ignores the possibility that both civilizations independently discovered pyramid construction" },

      { letter: "D", text: "It relies on incomplete archaeological evidence" },
      { letter: "E", text: "It does not establish the date when either civilization built pyramids" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument assumes shared characteristics must mean contact, ignoring independent invention. Pyramid shapes are structurally stable and obvious solutions for large constructions—multiple cultures could discover this independently without any contact.",

      { letter: "E", text: "The participants were selected from a variety of age groups" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "A control group showing no improvement (or decline) without naps demonstrates that the nap caused the improvement rather than just time of day effects, practice effects, or natural afternoon performance variations.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "This shows complexity may shift rather than decrease. If English lost inflections but developed other complex features, total complexity might be unchanged or increased. The argument cherry-picks one measure of complexity.",

      { letter: "E", text: "Audiences prefer plays with relevant themes" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "The argument concludes the play should be revived based solely on its timeless themes. For this to work, having timeless themes must be enough reason to perform a play. Otherwise, other factors might override the themes' relevance.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Server room access requires security clearance. Tom accessed the server room. Therefore, Tom has security clearance. He can't be an IT tech (given), but IT techs aren't the only ones with clearance (the statements don't say that).",

      { letter: "E", text: "The lectures covered complex scientific topics" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "More information isn't better if it's passively transcribed. Handwriting forces slower, more selective note-taking, requiring active engagement and processing that enhances understanding and retention, leading to better conceptual performance despite fewer notes.",

    stimulus: `Music critic: This composer's symphony has been called derivative. But all composers are influenced by those who came before them. Mozart was influenced by Haydn, and Brahms was influenced by Beethoven. Therefore, being influenced by predecessors does not make a work derivative.`,

      { letter: "E", text: "demonstrating that the symphony is original despite its influences" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The critic points out that acknowledged masterpieces (Mozart, Brahms) show the same characteristic (influence from predecessors) that the symphony is criticized for. If this trait exists in undisputedly original works, it can't be what makes something derivative.",

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "Both use: No A are B. X is A. Therefore, X is not B. Original: No menu items are low-cal; cake is on menu; cake isn't low-cal. A: No honors students are failing; James is honors; James isn't failing. Same valid pattern.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Selection bias: the survey only includes employers who hired graduates. Employers who reviewed but rejected these graduates aren't surveyed. The 85% satisfaction among those who hired might mask widespread rejection by those who didn't.",

    answerChoices: [
      { letter: "A", text: "The trails are heavily used by residents for walking and cycling" },
      { letter: "B", text: "Similar neighborhoods without rail-to-trail conversions saw property values rise only 5% over the same period" },

      { letter: "E", text: "Homeowners near the trails report high satisfaction with their neighborhoods" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "A comparison group is essential. If similar neighborhoods without trails saw only 5% increases while trail neighborhoods saw 15-20%, the difference (10-15%) can be attributed to the trails rather than general market trends.",

      { letter: "A", text: "Some students continued to go to bed at the same time after the schedule change" },

    ],
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Confounding variable. If new teaching methods were introduced simultaneously, the test score improvement could be due to better teaching rather than later start times. The two changes weren't isolated.",
