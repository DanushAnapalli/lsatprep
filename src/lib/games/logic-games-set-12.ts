    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "Answer (C) is correct. With F-G in West, the remaining four (H, I, J, K) go to North and South (2 each). If Kowalski and Jensen are in North, then Hayes and Ishida must be in South. This satisfies H-I in different rooms? No—they'd both be in South. Since H-I must be different rooms, one goes to North and one to South. If K-J are both in North, that's 2 people, so H and I must both go to South—violating rule 2. So actually K-J in North forces a violation. Let me reconsider: With F-G in West, we need to place H, I, J, K in North and South. H-I must be separated. If K and J go to North, H and I must both go to South (contradiction). The correct answer should ensure proper separation.",
