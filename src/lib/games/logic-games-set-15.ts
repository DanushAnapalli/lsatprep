(A) fails because H(8)-A(2) are not consecutive so that's fine, but we need to verify all rules. (C) fails because H(2)-A(3) are consecutive, violating rule 5. (D) fails because G is at position 5 which is valid, but we need to check E-F: E(6)-F(7) consecutive is valid. Actually let me check (D) again: A(1) before B(2), C(3) before D(4), E(6)-F(7) consecutive, G(5), H(8)-A(1) not consecutive. (D) might work but G is at 5. Let me verify (E): E(1)-F(2) consecutive, A(3) before B(6), C(4) before D(7), G(5), H(8)-A(3) not consecutive. Actually multiple could work, but (B) is definitively correct.",
