The remaining positions 6 and 7 must have Brown and Davis. Since Adams(1) is before Brown, and Chen(2) is before Davis, both constraints are satisfied. Brown and Davis in 6-7 could be either order unless rule 5 applies. If Brown(5)—but Farmer is 5. So Brown is 6 or 7, Davis is the other. Actually, Chen before Davis means Davis could be 6 or 7. More analysis needed, but Ellis(4) provides the most constraint.",
