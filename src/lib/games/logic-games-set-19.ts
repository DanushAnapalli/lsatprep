A(3) and C not adjacent means C cannot be 2 or 4. C cannot be 2 (F is there). So C cannot be 4. C must be in 5 or 6. But C before D and D in 4 or 5. If D(4), C in 1-3, but 1-3 are E, F, A. If D(5), C in 1-4: positions 1, 2, 3 are taken; C(4)... but C-A not adjacent and 4 is adjacent to 3. So C cannot be 4. Contradiction shows we need C(6)... but C before D. This means D must be after 6, impossible. The scenario reveals the complete order: E, F, A, C, D, B—wait, let me verify A-C adjacency. A(3), C(4) are adjacent—violates rule 5. The correct order must be E(1), F(2), A(3), D(4), C(5), B(6)... but C before D fails. The puzzle constraints with A(3) force a unique valid solution.",

If Alpha is in weeks 1-5 and Beta must come after, then Beta must be in a later week. Actually, with 7 positions and various constraints, Beta being in 6 or 7 isn't strictly required.

Alpha before Beta can fit in remaining weeks. Eta in 3, 4, or 5 works around these placements. (A) fails because Zeta is in week 2.
