Since Nakamura is on Blockchain (not CS), Martinez cannot be on Blockchain. With Kim on AI (rule 1) and Martinez not on BC, Martinez must be on AI or CS. Since we need all topics covered and need BC (Nakamura), CS, and AI (Kim)—someone must cover CS. If Martinez is on CS, that works. But if Martinez is on AI, then Lee or Okonkwo must cover CS. Actually, the question is what MUST be true. Let me reconsider—Martinez not being on BC doesn't force Martinez to AI specifically.",
