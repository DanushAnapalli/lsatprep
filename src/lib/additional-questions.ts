    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The argument concludes that early book exposure is the PRIMARY factor in vocabulary development. Answer (B) strengthens this by ruling out alternative explanations (socioeconomic status, parental education). This isolates book reading as the likely cause.",

      A: "This suggests a correlation but doesn't strengthen the causal link to vocabulary.",
      C: "While relevant, this doesn't show book exposure is the PRIMARY factor.",

    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "The paradox is: Why does a medication that's twice as effective in trials not produce better results in the real world? Answer (B) explains this by pointing to a key difference: trial participants follow the regimen perfectly, while real patients don't. The medication works when taken properly, but isn't taken properly in practice.",

    explanation: "The critic uses a reductio-style argument: IF social media made us more connected, THEN we'd see less loneliness and more close friendships. But we see the opposite. Therefore, the conclusion is likely wrong. This is testing implications of the conclusion against evidence.",

const rcPassage2 = `The debate over artificial intelligence's impact on employment has intensified as automation technologies become increasingly sophisticated. Optimists point to historical precedent: past technological revolutions, from the agricultural to the industrial, initially displaced workers but ultimately created more jobs than they eliminated. They argue that AI will follow the same pattern, generating entirely new categories of employment that we cannot yet envision.

However, this historical analogy may be misleading. Previous technological revolutions augmented human physical capabilities while leaving cognitive abilities as humanity's unique contribution to the economy. AI, by contrast, directly challenges human cognitive advantages. When machines can learn, reason, and make decisions, the traditional economic role of human workers becomes fundamentally uncertain.

Moreover, the pace of change may be unprecedented. The agricultural revolution unfolded over millennia; the industrial revolution, over centuries. AI-driven automation is accelerating on a timeline measured in decades or even years. This compressed timeframe may not allow for the gradual workforce transitions that characterized earlier technological shifts.

Some economists propose that the solution lies in education reform, preparing workers for jobs requiring skills that AI cannot easily replicate—creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex interpersonal interaction. Yet this prescription assumes that such skills will remain exclusively human domains, an assumption that AI researchers increasingly question as systems demonstrate unexpected capabilities in creative and social tasks.

The most honest assessment may be that we simply do not know how this transformation will unfold. Unlike previous technological transitions, we have no historical template for a technology that replicates human cognition itself. Policymakers and economists must therefore prepare for multiple scenarios, including possibilities quite different from any we have experienced before.`;
